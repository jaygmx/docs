# ‘sha1sum’: Print or check SHA-1 digests

‘sha1sum’ computes a 160-bit checksum for each specified FILE. The usage
and options of this command are precisely the same as for ‘md5sum’.
\*Note md5sum invocation::.

Note: The SHA-1 digest is more reliable than a simple CRC (provided by
the ‘cksum’ command) for detecting accidental file corruption, as the
chances of accidentally having two files with identical SHA-1 are
vanishingly small. However, it should not be considered secure against
malicious tampering: although finding a file with a given SHA-1
fingerprint is considered infeasible at the moment, it is known how to
modify certain files, including digital certificates, so that they
appear valid when signed with an SHA-1 digest. For more secure hashes,
consider using SHA-2, or the newer ‘b2sum’ command. \*Note sha2
utilities::. \*Note b2sum invocation::.
