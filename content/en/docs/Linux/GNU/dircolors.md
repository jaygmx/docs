# ‘dircolors’: Color setup for ‘ls’

‘dircolors’ outputs a sequence of shell commands to set up the terminal
for color output from ‘ls’ (and ‘dir’, etc.). Typical usage:

``` 
 eval "$(dircolors [OPTION]... [FILE])"
```

If FILE is specified, ‘dircolors’ reads it to determine which colors to
use for which file types and extensions. Otherwise, a precompiled
database is used. For details on the format of these files, run
‘dircolors --print-database’.

To make ‘dircolors’ read a ‘\~/.dircolors’ file if it exists, you can
put the following lines in your ‘\~/.bashrc’ (or adapt them to your
favorite shell):

``` 
 d=.dircolors
 test -r $d && eval "$(dircolors $d)"
```

The output is a shell command to set the ‘LS\_COLORS’ environment
variable. You can specify the shell syntax to use on the command line,
or ‘dircolors’ will guess it from the value of the ‘SHELL’ environment
variable.

The program accepts the following options. Also see \*note Common
options::.

‘-b’ ‘--sh’ ‘--bourne-shell’ Output Bourne shell commands. This is the
default if the ‘SHELL’ environment variable is set and does not end with
‘csh’ or ‘tcsh’.

‘-c’ ‘--csh’ ‘--c-shell’ Output C shell commands. This is the default if
‘SHELL’ ends with ‘csh’ or ‘tcsh’.

‘-p’ ‘--print-database’ Print the (compiled-in) default color
configuration database. This output is itself a valid configuration
file, and is fairly descriptive of the possibilities.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.
