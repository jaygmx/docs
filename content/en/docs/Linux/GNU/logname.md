# ‘logname’: Print current login name

‘logname’ prints the calling user’s name, as found in a
system-maintained file (often ‘/var/run/utmp’ or ‘/etc/utmp’), and exits
with a status of 0. If there is no entry for the calling process,
‘logname’ prints an error message and exits with a status of 1.

The only options are ‘--help’ and ‘--version’. \*Note Common options::.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.
