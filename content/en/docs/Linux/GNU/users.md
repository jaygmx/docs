# ‘users’: Print login names of users currently logged in

‘users’ prints on a single line a blank-separated list of user names of
users currently logged in to the current host. Each user name
corresponds to a login session, so if a user has more than one login
session, that user’s name will appear the same number of times in the
output.
Synopsis:

``` 
 users [FILE]
```

With no FILE argument, ‘users’ extracts its information from a
system-maintained file (often ‘/var/run/utmp’ or ‘/etc/utmp’). If a file
argument is given, ‘users’ uses that file instead. A common choice is
‘/var/log/wtmp’.

The only options are ‘--help’ and ‘--version’. \*Note Common options::.

The ‘users’ command is installed only on platforms with the POSIX
‘\<utmpx.h\>’ include file or equivalent, so portable scripts should
not rely on its existence on non-POSIX platforms.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.
