# ‘uname’: Print system information

‘uname’ prints information about the machine and operating system it is
run on. If no options are given, ‘uname’ acts as if the ‘-s’ option were
given.
Synopsis:

```bash
 uname [OPTION]...
```

If multiple options or ‘-a’ are given, the selected information is
printed in this order:

```bash
 KERNEL-NAME NODENAME KERNEL-RELEASE KERNEL-VERSION
 MACHINE PROCESSOR HARDWARE-PLATFORM OPERATING-SYSTEM
```

The information may contain internal spaces, so such output cannot be
parsed reliably. In the following example, RELEASE is
‘2.2.18ss.e820-bda652a \#4 SMP Tue Jun 5 11:24:08 PDT 2001’:

```bash 
 uname -a
 ⇒ Linux dumdum 2.2.18 #4 SMP Tue Jun 5 11:24:08 PDT 2001 i686 unknown unknown GNU/Linux
```

The program accepts the following options. Also see \*note Common
options::.

‘-a’ ‘--all’ Print all of the below information, except omit the
processor type and the hardware platform name if they are unknown.

‘-i’ ‘--hardware-platform’ Print the hardware platform name (sometimes
called the hardware implementation). Print ‘unknown’ if this information
is not available. Note this is non-portable (even across GNU/Linux
distributions).

‘-m’ ‘--machine’ Print the machine hardware name (sometimes called the
hardware class or hardware type).

‘-n’ ‘--nodename’ Print the network node hostname.

‘-p’ ‘--processor’ Print the processor type (sometimes called the
instruction set architecture or ISA). Print ‘unknown’ if this
information is not available. Note this is non-portable (even across
GNU/Linux distributions).

‘-o’ ‘--operating-system’ Print the name of the operating system.

‘-r’ ‘--kernel-release’ Print the kernel release.

‘-s’ ‘--kernel-name’ Print the kernel name. POSIX 1003.1-2001 (\*note
Standards conformance::) calls this “the implementation of the operating
system”, because the POSIX specification itself has no notion of
“kernel”. The kernel name might be the same as the operating system
name printed by the ‘-o’ or ‘--operating-system’ option, but it might
differ. Some operating systems (e.g., FreeBSD, HP-UX) have the same name
as their underlying kernels; others (e.g., GNU/Linux, Solaris) do not.

‘-v’ ‘--kernel-version’ Print the kernel version.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.
