# ‘sum’: Print checksum and block counts

‘sum’ computes a 16-bit checksum for each given FILE, or standard input
if none are given or for a FILE of ‘-’.
Synopsis:

``` 
 sum [OPTION]... [FILE]...
```

‘sum’ prints the checksum for each FILE followed by the number of blocks
in the file (rounded up). If more than one FILE is given, file names are
also printed (by default). (With the ‘--sysv’ option, corresponding file
names are printed when there is at least one file argument.)

By default, GNU ‘sum’ computes checksums using an algorithm compatible
with BSD ‘sum’ and prints file sizes in units of 1024-byte blocks.

The program accepts the following options. Also see \*note Common
options::.

‘-r’ Use the default (BSD compatible) algorithm. This option is included
for compatibility with the System V ‘sum’. Unless ‘-s’ was also given,
it has no effect.

‘-s’ ‘--sysv’ Compute checksums using an algorithm compatible with
System V ‘sum’’s default, and print file sizes in units of 512-byte
blocks.

‘sum’ is provided for compatibility; the ‘cksum’ program (see next
section) is preferable in new applications.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.
