# ‘base64’: Transform data into printable data

‘base64’ transforms data read from a file, or standard input, into (or
from) base64 encoded form. The base64 encoded form uses printable ASCII
characters to represent binary data. Synopses:

``` 
 base64 [OPTION]... [FILE]
 base64 --decode [OPTION]... [FILE]
```

The base64 encoding expands data to roughly 133% of the original. The
base32 encoding expands data to roughly 160% of the original. The format
conforms to RFC 4648 (https://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc4648).

The program accepts the following options. Also see \*note Common
options::.

‘-w COLS’ ‘--wrap=COLS’ During encoding, wrap lines after COLS
characters. This must be a positive number.

``` 
 The default is to wrap after 76 characters.  Use the value 0 to
 disable line wrapping altogether.
```

‘-d’ ‘--decode’ Change the mode of operation, from the default of
encoding data, to decoding data. Input is expected to be base64 encoded
data, and the output will be the original data.

‘-i’ ‘--ignore-garbage’ When decoding, newlines are always accepted.
During decoding, ignore unrecognized bytes, to permit distorted data to
be decoded.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.
