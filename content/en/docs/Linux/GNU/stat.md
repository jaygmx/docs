# ‘stat’: Report file or file system status

‘stat’ displays information about the specified file(s).
Synopsis:

``` 
 stat [OPTION]... [FILE]...
```

With no option, ‘stat’ reports all information about the given files.
But it also can be used to report the information of the file systems
the given files are located on. If the files are links, ‘stat’ can also
give information about the files the links point to.

Due to shell aliases and built-in ‘stat’ functions, using an unadorned
‘stat’ interactively or in a script may get you different
functionality than that described here. Invoke it via ‘env’ (i.e., ‘env
stat ...’) to avoid interference from the shell.

‘-L’ ‘--dereference’ Change how ‘stat’ treats symbolic links. With this
option, ‘stat’ acts on the file referenced by each symbolic link
argument. Without it, ‘stat’ acts on any symbolic link argument
directly.

‘-f’ ‘--file-system’ Report information about the file systems where the
given files are located instead of information about the files
themselves. This option implies the ‘-L’ option.

‘-c’ ‘--format=FORMAT’ Use FORMAT rather than the default format. FORMAT
is automatically newline-terminated, so running a command like the
following with two or more FILE operands produces a line of output for
each operand: $ stat --format=%d:%i / /usr 2050:2 2057:2

‘--printf=FORMAT’ Use FORMAT rather than the default format. Like
‘--format’, but interpret backslash escapes, and do not output a
mandatory trailing newline. If you want a newline, include ‘\\n’ in the
FORMAT. Here’s how you would use ‘--printf’ to print the device and
inode numbers of ‘/’ and ‘/usr’: $ stat --printf='%d:%i\\n' / /usr
2050:2 2057:2

‘-t’ ‘--terse’ Print the information in terse form, suitable for parsing
by other programs.

``` 
 The output of the following commands are identical and the
 ‘--format’ also identifies the items printed (in fuller form) in
 the default format.  Note the format string would include another
 ‘%C’ at the end with an active SELinux security context.
      $ stat --format="%n %s %b %f %u %g %D %i %h %t %T %X %Y %Z %W %o" ...
      $ stat --terse ...

 The same illustrating terse output in ‘--file-system’ mode:
      $ stat -f --format="%n %i %l %t %s %S %b %f %a %c %d" ...
      $ stat -f --terse ...
```

The valid FORMAT directives for files with ‘--format’ and ‘--printf’
are:

• %a - Access rights in octal (note ‘\#’ and ‘0’ printf flags) • %A -
Access rights in human readable form • %b - Number of blocks allocated
(see ‘%B’) • %B - The size in bytes of each block reported by ‘%b’ • %C
- The SELinux security context of a file, if available • %d - Device
number in decimal • %D - Device number in hex • %f - Raw mode in hex •
%F - File type • %g - Group ID of owner • %G - Group name of owner • %h
- Number of hard links • %i - Inode number • %m - Mount point (See note
below) • %n - File name • %N - Quoted file name with dereference if
symbolic link (see below) • %o - Optimal I/O transfer size hint • %s -
Total size, in bytes • %t - Major device type in hex (see below) • %T -
Minor device type in hex (see below) • %u - User ID of owner • %U - User
name of owner • %w - Time of file birth, or ‘-’ if unknown • %W - Time
of file birth as seconds since Epoch, or ‘0’ • %x - Time of last access
• %X - Time of last access as seconds since Epoch • %y - Time of last
data modification • %Y - Time of last data modification as seconds since
Epoch • %z - Time of last status change • %Z - Time of last status
change as seconds since Epoch

The ‘%a’ format prints the octal mode, and so it is useful to control
the zero padding of the output with the ‘\#’ and ‘0’ printf flags. For
example to pad to at least 3 wide while making larger numbers
unambiguously octal, you can use ‘%\#03a’.

The ‘%N’ format can be set with the environment variable
‘QUOTING\_STYLE’. If that environment variable is not set, the
default value is ‘shell-escape-always’. Valid quoting styles are:
‘literal’ Output strings as-is; this is the same as the ‘-N’ or
‘--literal’ option. ‘shell’ Quote strings for the shell if they
contain shell metacharacters or would cause ambiguous output. The
quoting is suitable for POSIX-compatible shells like ‘bash’, but it does
not always work for incompatible shells like ‘csh’. ‘shell-always’ Quote
strings for the shell, even if they would normally not require quoting.
‘shell-escape’ Like ‘shell’, but also quoting non-printable characters
using the POSIX proposed ‘$''’ syntax suitable for most shells.
‘shell-escape-always’ Like ‘shell-escape’, but quote strings even if
they would normally not require quoting. ‘c’ Quote strings as for C
character string literals, including the surrounding double-quote
characters; this is the same as the ‘-Q’ or ‘--quote-name’ option.
‘escape’ Quote strings as for C character string literals, except omit
the surrounding double-quote characters; this is the same as the ‘-b’ or
‘--escape’ option. ‘clocale’ Quote strings as for C character string
literals, except use surrounding quotation marks appropriate for the
locale. ‘locale’ Quote strings as for C character string literals,
except use surrounding quotation marks appropriate for the locale, and
quote 'like this' instead of "like this" in the default C locale. This
looks nicer on many displays.

The ‘%t’ and ‘%T’ formats operate on the st\_rdev member of the stat(2)
structure, and are only defined for character and block special files.
On some systems or file types, st\_rdev may be used to represent other
quantities.

The ‘%W’, ‘%X’, ‘%Y’, and ‘%Z’ formats accept a precision preceded by a
period to specify the number of digits to print after the decimal point.
For example, ‘%.3X’ outputs the access timestamp to millisecond
precision. If a period is given but no precision, ‘stat’ uses 9 digits,
so ‘%.X’ is equivalent to ‘%.9X’. When discarding excess precision,
timestamps are truncated toward minus infinity.

``` 
 zero pad:
   $ stat -c '[%015Y]' /usr
   [000001288929712]
 space align:
   $ stat -c '[%15Y]' /usr
   [     1288929712]
   $ stat -c '[%-15Y]' /usr
   [1288929712     ]
 precision:
   $ stat -c '[%.3Y]' /usr
   [1288929712.114]
   $ stat -c '[%.Y]' /usr
   [1288929712.114951834]
```

The mount point printed by ‘%m’ is similar to that output by ‘df’,
except that: • stat does not dereference symlinks by default (unless
‘-L’ is specified) • stat does not search for specified device nodes
in the file system list, instead operating on them directly • stat
outputs the alias for a bind mounted file, rather than the initial mount
point of its backing device. One can recursively call stat until there
is no change in output, to get the current base mount point

When listing file system information (‘--file-system’ (‘-f’)), you must
use a different set of FORMAT directives:

• %a - Free blocks available to non-super-user • %b - Total data blocks
in file system • %c - Total file nodes in file system • %d - Free file
nodes in file system • %f - Free blocks in file system • %i - File
System ID in hex • %l - Maximum length of file names • %n - File name •
%s - Block size (for faster transfers) • %S - Fundamental block size
(for block counts) • %t - Type in hex • %T - Type in human readable form

Timestamps are listed according to the time zone rules specified by the
‘TZ’ environment variable, or by the system default rules if ‘TZ’ is
not set. \*Note Specifying the Time Zone with ‘TZ’: (libc)TZ Variable.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.
