# ‘chcon’: Change SELinux context of file

‘chcon’ changes the SELinux security context of the selected files.
Synopses:

``` 
 chcon [OPTION]... CONTEXT FILE...
 chcon [OPTION]... [-u USER] [-r ROLE] [-l RANGE] [-t TYPE] FILE...
 chcon [OPTION]... --reference=RFILE FILE...
```

Change the SELinux security context of each FILE to CONTEXT. With
‘--reference’, change the security context of each FILE to that of
RFILE.

The program accepts the following options. Also see \*note Common
options::.

‘--dereference’ Do not affect symbolic links but what they refer to;
this is the default.

‘-h’ ‘--no-dereference’ Affect the symbolic links themselves instead of
any referenced file.

‘--reference=RFILE’ Use RFILE’s security context rather than specifying
a CONTEXT value.

‘-R’ ‘--recursive’ Operate on files and directories recursively.

‘--preserve-root’ Refuse to operate recursively on the root directory,
‘/’, when used together with the ‘--recursive’ option. \*Note Treating
/ specially::.

‘--no-preserve-root’ Do not treat the root directory, ‘/’, specially
when operating recursively; this is the default. \*Note Treating /
specially::.

‘-H’ If ‘--recursive’ (‘-R’) is specified and a command line argument is
a symbolic link to a directory, traverse it. \*Note Traversing
symlinks::.

‘-L’ In a recursive traversal, traverse every symbolic link to a
directory that is encountered. \*Note Traversing symlinks::.

‘-P’ Do not traverse any symbolic links. This is the default if none of
‘-H’, ‘-L’, or ‘-P’ is specified. \*Note Traversing symlinks::.

‘-v’ ‘--verbose’ Output a diagnostic for every file processed.

‘-u USER’ ‘--user=USER’ Set user USER in the target security context.

‘-r ROLE’ ‘--role=ROLE’ Set role ROLE in the target security context.

‘-t TYPE’ ‘--type=TYPE’ Set type TYPE in the target security context.

‘-l RANGE’ ‘--range=RANGE’ Set range RANGE in the target security
context.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.
