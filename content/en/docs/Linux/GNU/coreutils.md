## 1 Introduction

This manual is a work in progress: many sections make no attempt to
explain basic concepts in a way suitable for novices. Thus, if you are
interested, please get involved in improving this manual. The entire GNU
community will benefit.

<span id="index-POSIX"></span>

The GNU utilities documented here are mostly compatible with the POSIX
standard. <span id="index-bugs_002c-reporting"></span>

Please report bugs to <bug-coreutils@gnu.org>. Include the version
number, machine architecture, input files, and any other information
needed to reproduce the bug: your input, what you expected, what you
got, and why it is wrong.

If you have a problem with `sort` or `date`, try using the `--debug`
option, as it can often help find and fix problems without having to
wait for an answer to a bug report. If the debug output does not suffice
to fix the problem on your own, please compress and attach it to the
rest of your bug report.

Although diffs are welcome, please include a description of the problem
as well, since this is sometimes difficult to infer. See
[Bugs](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Bugs.html#Bugs) in Using and
Porting GNU CC.

This manual was originally derived from the Unix man pages in the
distributions, which were written by David MacKenzie and updated by Jim
Meyering. What you are reading now is the authoritative documentation
for these utilities; the man pages are no longer being maintained. The
original `fmt` man page was written by Ross Paterson. François Pinard
did the initial conversion to Texinfo format. Karl Berry did the
indexing, some reorganization, and editing of the results. Brian Youmans
of the Free Software Foundation office staff combined the manuals for
textutils, fileutils, and sh-utils to produce the present omnibus
manual. Richard Stallman contributed his usual invaluable insights to
the overall process.

<span id="Common-options-1"></span>

## 2 Common options

<span id="index-common-options"></span>

Certain options are available in all of these programs. Rather than
writing identical descriptions for each of the programs, they are
described here. (In fact, every GNU program accepts (or should accept)
these options.)

<span id="index-POSIXLY_005fCORRECT"></span>

Normally options and operands can appear in any order, and programs act
as if all the options appear before any operands. For example,
‘`sort -r passwd -t :`’ acts like ‘`sort -r -t : passwd`’, since ‘`:`’
is an option-argument of `-t`. However, if the `POSIXLY_CORRECT`
environment variable is set, options must appear before operands, unless
otherwise specified for a particular command.

A few programs can usefully have trailing operands with leading ‘`-`’.
With such a program, options must precede operands even if
`POSIXLY_CORRECT` is not set, and this fact is noted in the program
description. For example, the `env` command’s options must appear before
its operands, since in some cases the operands specify a command that
itself contains options.

Most programs that accept long options recognize unambiguous
abbreviations of those options. For example,
‘`rmdir --ignore-fail-on-non-empty`’ can be invoked as
‘`rmdir --ignore-fail`’ or even ‘`rmdir --i`’. Ambiguous options, such
as ‘`ls --h`’, are identified as such.

Some of these programs recognize the `--help` and `--version` options
only when one of them is the sole command line argument. For these
programs, abbreviations of the long options are not always recognized.

‘`--help`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dhelp"></span> <span
id="index-help_002c-online"></span>

Print a usage message listing all available options, then exit
successfully.

‘`--version`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dversion"></span> <span
id="index-version-number_002c-finding"></span>

Print the version number, then exit successfully.

‘`--`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002d"></span> <span
id="index-option-delimiter"></span>

Delimit the option list. Later arguments, if any, are treated as
operands even if they begin with ‘`-`’. For example, ‘`sort -- -r`’
reads from the file named `-r`.

<span id="index-standard-input"></span> <span
id="index-standard-output"></span>

A single ‘`-`’ operand is not really an option, though it looks like
one. It stands for a file operand, and some tools treat it as standard
input, or as standard output if that is clear from the context. For
example, ‘`sort -`’ reads from standard input, and is equivalent to
plain ‘`sort`’. Unless otherwise specified, a ‘`-`’ can appear as any
operand that requires a file name.

### 2.1 Exit status

Nearly every command invocation yields an integral *exit status* that
can be used to change how other commands work. For the vast majority of
commands, an exit status of zero indicates success. Failure is indicated
by a nonzero value—typically ‘`1`’, though it may differ on unusual
platforms as POSIX requires only that it be nonzero.

However, some of the programs documented here do produce other exit
status values and a few associate different meanings with the values
‘`0`’ and ‘`1`’. Here are some of the exceptions: `chroot`, `env`,
`expr`, `nice`, `nohup`, `numfmt`, `printenv`, `sort`, `stdbuf`, `test`,
`timeout`, `tty`.

### 2.2 Backup options

<span id="index-backup-options"></span>

Some GNU programs (at least `cp`, `install`, `ln`, and `mv`) optionally
make backups of files before writing new versions. These options control
the details of these backups. The options are also briefly mentioned in
the descriptions of the particular programs.

‘`-b`’  
‘`--backup[=method]`’  
<span id="index-_002db"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dbackup"></span> <span
id="index-VERSION_005fCONTROL"></span> <span
id="index-backups_002c-making"></span>

Make a backup of each file that would otherwise be overwritten or
removed. Without this option, the original versions are destroyed. Use
`method` to determine the type of backups to make. When this option is
used but `method` is not specified, then the value of the
`VERSION_CONTROL` environment variable is used. And if `VERSION_CONTROL`
is not set, the default backup type is ‘`existing`’.

Note that the short form of this option, `-b` does not accept any
argument. Using `-b` is equivalent to using `--backup=existing`.

<span id="index-version_002dcontrol-Emacs-variable"></span>

This option corresponds to the Emacs variable ‘`version-control`’; the
values for `method` are the same as those used in Emacs. This option
also accepts more descriptive names. The valid `method`s are (unique
abbreviations are accepted):

‘`none`’  
‘`off`’  
<span id="index-none-backup-method"></span>

Never make backups.

‘`numbered`’  
‘`t`’  
<span id="index-numbered-backup-method"></span>

Always make numbered backups.

‘`existing`’  
‘`nil`’  
<span id="index-existing-backup-method"></span>

Make numbered backups of files that already have them, simple backups of
the others.

‘`simple`’  
‘`never`’  
<span id="index-simple-backup-method"></span>

Always make simple backups. Please note ‘`never`’ is not to be confused
with ‘`none`’.

‘`-S suffix`’  
‘`--suffix=suffix`’  
<span id="index-_002dS"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dsuffix"></span> <span
id="index-backup-suffix"></span> <span
id="index-SIMPLE_005fBACKUP_005fSUFFIX"></span>

Append `suffix` to each backup file made with `-b`. If this option is
not specified, the value of the `SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX` environment
variable is used. And if `SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX` is not set, the default
is ‘`~`’, just as in Emacs.

<span id="Block-size-1"></span>

### 2.3 Block size

<span id="index-block-size"></span>

Some GNU programs (at least `df`, `du`, and `ls`) display sizes in
“blocks”. You can adjust the block size and method of display to make
sizes easier to read. The block size used for display is independent of
any file system block size. Fractional block counts are rounded up to
the nearest integer.

<span id="index-_002d_002dblock_002dsize_003dsize"></span> <span
id="index-BLOCKSIZE"></span> <span id="index-BLOCK_005fSIZE"></span>
<span id="index-DF_005fBLOCK_005fSIZE"></span> <span
id="index-DU_005fBLOCK_005fSIZE"></span> <span
id="index-LS_005fBLOCK_005fSIZE"></span> <span
id="index-POSIXLY_005fCORRECT_002c-and-block-size"></span>

The default block size is chosen by examining the following environment
variables in turn; the first one that is set determines the block size.

`DF_BLOCK_SIZE`  
This specifies the default block size for the `df` command. Similarly,
`DU_BLOCK_SIZE` specifies the default for `du` and `LS_BLOCK_SIZE` for
`ls`.

`BLOCK_SIZE`  
This specifies the default block size for all three commands, if the
above command-specific environment variables are not set.

`BLOCKSIZE`  
This specifies the default block size for all values that are normally
printed as blocks, if neither `BLOCK_SIZE` nor the above
command-specific environment variables are set. Unlike the other
environment variables, `BLOCKSIZE` does not affect values that are
normally printed as byte counts, e.g., the file sizes contained in
`ls -l` output.

`POSIXLY_CORRECT`  
If neither `command_BLOCK_SIZE`, nor `BLOCK_SIZE`, nor `BLOCKSIZE` is
set, but this variable is set, the block size defaults to 512.

If none of the above environment variables are set, the block size
currently defaults to 1024 bytes in most contexts, but this number may
change in the future. For `ls` file sizes, the block size defaults to 1
byte.

<span id="index-human_002dreadable-output"></span> <span
id="index-SI-output"></span>

A block size specification can be a positive integer specifying the
number of bytes per block, or it can be `human-readable` or `si` to
select a human-readable format. Integers may be followed by suffixes
that are upward compatible with the [SI
prefixes](http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/chapter3.html)
for decimal multiples and with the [ISO/IEC 80000-13 (formerly IEC
60027-2) prefixes](https://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html) for
binary multiples.

With human-readable formats, output sizes are followed by a size letter
such as ‘`M`’ for megabytes. `BLOCK_SIZE=human-readable` uses powers of
1024; ‘`M`’ stands for 1,048,576 bytes. `BLOCK_SIZE=si` is similar, but
uses powers of 1000 and appends ‘`B`’; ‘`MB`’ stands for 1,000,000
bytes.

<span id="index-LC_005fNUMERIC"></span>

A block size specification preceded by ‘`'`’ causes output sizes to be
displayed with thousands separators. The `LC_NUMERIC` locale specifies
the thousands separator and grouping. For example, in an American
English locale, ‘`--block-size="'1kB"`’ would cause a size of 1234000
bytes to be displayed as ‘`1,234`’. In the default C locale, there is no
thousands separator so a leading ‘`'`’ has no effect.

An integer block size can be followed by a suffix to specify a multiple
of that size. A bare size letter, or one followed by ‘`iB`’, specifies a
multiple using powers of 1024. A size letter followed by ‘`B`’ specifies
powers of 1000 instead. For example, ‘`1M`’ and ‘`1MiB`’ are equivalent
to ‘`1048576`’, whereas ‘`1MB`’ is equivalent to ‘`1000000`’.

A plain suffix without a preceding integer acts as if ‘`1`’ were
prepended, except that it causes a size indication to be appended to the
output. For example, ‘`--block-size="kB"`’ displays 3000 as ‘`3kB`’.

The following suffixes are defined. Large sizes like `1Y` may be
rejected by your computer due to limitations of its arithmetic.

‘`kB`’  
<span id="index-kilobyte_002c-definition-of"></span>

kilobyte: *10^3 = 1000*.

‘`k`’  
‘`K`’  
‘`KiB`’  
<span id="index-kibibyte_002c-definition-of"></span>

kibibyte: *2^{10} = 1024*. ‘`K`’ is special: the SI prefix is ‘`k`’ and
the ISO/IEC 80000-13 prefix is ‘`Ki`’, but tradition and POSIX use ‘`k`’
to mean ‘`KiB`’.

‘`MB`’  
<span id="index-megabyte_002c-definition-of"></span>

megabyte: *10^6 = 1,000,000*.

‘`M`’  
‘`MiB`’  
<span id="index-mebibyte_002c-definition-of"></span>

mebibyte: *2^{20} = 1,048,576*.

‘`GB`’  
<span id="index-gigabyte_002c-definition-of"></span>

gigabyte: *10^9 = 1,000,000,000*.

‘`G`’  
‘`GiB`’  
<span id="index-gibibyte_002c-definition-of"></span>

gibibyte: *2^{30} = 1,073,741,824*.

‘`TB`’  
<span id="index-terabyte_002c-definition-of"></span>

‘`TiB`’  
<span id="index-tebibyte_002c-definition-of"></span>

tebibyte: *2^{40} = 1,099,511,627,776*.

‘`PB`’  
<span id="index-petabyte_002c-definition-of"></span>

petabyte: *10^{15} = 1,000,000,000,000,000*.

‘`P`’  
‘`PiB`’  
<span id="index-pebibyte_002c-definition-of"></span>

‘`EB`’  
<span id="index-exabyte_002c-definition-of"></span>

exabyte: *10^{18} = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000*.

‘`E`’  
‘`EiB`’  
<span id="index-exbibyte_002c-definition-of"></span>

exbibyte: *2^{60} = 1,152,921,504,606,846,976*.

‘`ZB`’  
<span id="index-zettabyte_002c-definition-of"></span>

zettabyte: *10^{21} = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000*

‘`Z`’  
‘`ZiB`’  
*2^{70} = 1,180,591,620,717,411,303,424*.

‘`YB`’  
<span id="index-yottabyte_002c-definition-of"></span>

yottabyte: *10^{24} = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000*.

‘`Y`’  
‘`YiB`’  
*2^{80} = 1,208,925,819,614,629,174,706,176*.

<span id="index-_002dk"></span> <span id="index-_002dh"></span> <span

id="index-_002d_002dhuman_002dreadable"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dsi"></span>

Block size defaults can be overridden by an explicit `--block-size=size`
option. The `-k` option is equivalent to `--block-size=1K`, which is the
default unless the `POSIXLY_CORRECT` environment variable is set. The
`-h` or `--human-readable` option is equivalent to
`--block-size=human-readable`. The `--si` option is equivalent to
`--block-size=si`. Note for `ls` the `-k` option does not control the
display of the apparent file sizes, whereas the `--block-size` option
does.

### 2.4 Floating point numbers

<span id="index-floating-point"></span> <span
id="index-IEEE-floating-point"></span>

Commands that accept or produce floating point numbers employ the
floating point representation of the underlying system, and suffer from
rounding error, overflow, and similar floating-point issues. Almost all
modern systems use IEEE-754 floating point, and it is typically portable
to assume IEEE-754 behavior these days. IEEE-754 has positive and
negative infinity, distinguishes positive from negative zero, and uses
special values called NaNs to represent invalid computations such as
dividing zero by itself. For more information, please see David
Goldberg’s paper [What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About
Floating-Point
Arithmetic](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html).

Commands that accept floating point numbers as options, operands or
input use the standard C functions `strtod` and `strtold` to convert
from text to floating point numbers. These floating point numbers
therefore can use scientific notation like `1.0e-34` and `-10e100`.
Commands that parse floating point also understand case-insensitive
`inf`, `infinity`, and `NaN`, although whether such values are useful
depends on the command in question. Modern C implementations also accept
hexadecimal floating point numbers such as `-0x.ep-3`, which stands for
-14/16 times *2^-3*, which equals -0.109375. See [Parsing of
Floats](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_mono/libc.html#Parsing-of-Floats)
in The GNU C Library Reference Manual.

<span id="index-LC_005fNUMERIC-1"></span>

Normally the `LC_NUMERIC` locale determines the decimal-point character.
However, some commands’ descriptions specify that they accept numbers in
either the current or the C locale; for example, they treat ‘`3.14`’
like ‘`3,14`’ if the current locale uses comma as a decimal point.

### 2.5 Signal specifications

<span id="index-signals_002c-specifying"></span>

A `signal` may be a signal name like ‘`HUP`’, or a signal number like
‘`1`’, or an exit status of a process terminated by the signal. A signal
name can be given in canonical form or prefixed by ‘`SIG`’. The case of
the letters is ignored. The following signal names and numbers are
supported on all POSIX compliant systems:

‘`HUP`’  
1\. Hangup.

‘`INT`’  
2\. Terminal interrupt.

‘`QUIT`’  
3\. Terminal quit.

‘`ABRT`’  
6\. Process abort.

‘`KILL`’  
9\. Kill (cannot be caught or ignored).

‘`ALRM`’  
14\. Alarm Clock.

‘`TERM`’  
15\. Termination.

Other supported signal names have system-dependent corresponding
numbers. All systems conforming to POSIX 1003.1-2001 also support the
following signals:

‘`BUS`’  
Access to an undefined portion of a memory object.

‘`CHLD`’  
Child process terminated, stopped, or continued.

‘`CONT`’  
Continue executing, if stopped.

‘`FPE`’  
Erroneous arithmetic operation.

‘`ILL`’  
Illegal Instruction.

‘`PIPE`’  
Write on a pipe with no one to read it.

‘`SEGV`’  
Invalid memory reference.

‘`STOP`’  
Stop executing (cannot be caught or ignored).

‘`TSTP`’  
Terminal stop.

‘`TTIN`’  
Background process attempting read.

‘`TTOU`’  
Background process attempting write.

‘`URG`’  
High bandwidth data is available at a socket.

‘`USR1`’  
User-defined signal 1.

‘`USR2`’  
User-defined signal 2.

POSIX 1003.1-2001 systems that support the XSI extension also support
the following signals:

‘`POLL`’  
Pollable event.

‘`PROF`’  
Profiling timer expired.

‘`SYS`’  
Bad system call.

‘`TRAP`’  
Trace/breakpoint trap.

‘`VTALRM`’  
Virtual timer expired.

‘`XCPU`’  
CPU time limit exceeded.

‘`XFSZ`’  
File size limit exceeded.

POSIX 1003.1-2001 systems that support the XRT extension also support at
least eight real-time signals called ‘`RTMIN`’, ‘`RTMIN+1`’, …,
‘`RTMAX-1`’, ‘`RTMAX`’.

### 2.6 chown, chgrp, chroot, id: Disambiguating user names and IDs

<span id="index-user-names_002c-disambiguating"></span> <span
id="index-user-IDs_002c-disambiguating"></span> <span
id="index-group-names_002c-disambiguating"></span> <span
id="index-group-IDs_002c-disambiguating"></span> <span
id="index-disambiguating-group-names-and-IDs"></span>

Since the `user` and `group` arguments to these commands may be
specified as names or numeric IDs, there is an apparent ambiguity. What
if a user or group *name* is a string of digits?
<a href="#FOOT1" id="DOCF1"><sup>1</sup></a> Should the command
interpret it as a user name or as an ID? POSIX requires that these
commands first attempt to resolve the specified string as a name, and
only once that fails, then try to interpret it as an ID. This is
troublesome when you want to specify a numeric ID, say 42, and it must
work even in a pathological situation where ‘`42`’ is a user name that
maps to some other user ID, say 1000. Simply invoking `chown 42 F`, will
set `F`s owner ID to 1000—not what you intended.

GNU `chown`, `chgrp`, `chroot`, and `id` provide a way to work around
this, that at the same time may result in a significant performance
improvement by eliminating a database look-up. Simply precede each
numeric user ID and/or group ID with a ‘`+`’, in order to force its
interpretation as an integer:

<div class="example">

``` example
chown +42 F
chgrp +$numeric_group_id another-file
chown +0:+0 /
```

</div>

The name look-up process is skipped for each ‘`+`’-prefixed string,
because a string containing ‘`+`’ is never a valid user or group name.
This syntax is accepted on most common Unix systems, but not on Solaris
10.

<span id="Sources-of-random-data"></span>

### 2.7 Sources of random data

<span id="index-random-sources"></span>

The `shuf`, `shred`, and `sort` commands sometimes need random data to
do their work. For example, ‘`sort -R`’ must choose a hash function at
random, and it needs random data to make this selection.

By default these commands use an internal pseudo-random generator
initialized by a small amount of entropy, but can be directed to use an
external source with the `--random-source=file` option. An error is
reported if `file` does not contain enough bytes.

For example, the device file `/dev/urandom` could be used as the source
of random data. Typically, this device gathers environmental noise from
device drivers and other sources into an entropy pool, and uses the pool
to generate random bits. If the pool is short of data, the device reuses
the internal pool to produce more bits, using a cryptographically secure
pseudo-random number generator. But be aware that this device is not
designed for bulk random data generation and is relatively slow.

`/dev/urandom` suffices for most practical uses, but applications
requiring high-value or long-term protection of private data may require
an alternate data source like `/dev/random` or `/dev/arandom`. The set
of available sources depends on your operating system.

To reproduce the results of an earlier invocation of a command, you can
save some random data into a file and then use that file as the random
source in earlier and later invocations of the command. <span
id="index-random-seed"></span> Rather than depending on a file, one can
generate a reproducible arbitrary amount of pseudo-random data given a
seed value, using for example:

<div class="example">

``` example
get_seeded_random()
{
  seed="$1"
  openssl enc -aes-256-ctr -pass pass:"$seed" -nosalt \
    </dev/zero 2>/dev/null
}

shuf -i1-100 --random-source=<(get_seeded_random 42)

### 2.8 Target directory

<span id="index-target-directory"></span>

The `cp`, `install`, `ln`, and `mv` commands normally treat the last
operand specially when it is a directory or a symbolic link to a
directory. For example, ‘`cp source dest`’ is equivalent to
‘`cp source dest/source`’ if `dest` is a directory. Sometimes this
behavior is not exactly what is wanted, so these commands support the
following options to allow more fine-grained control:

‘`-T`’  
‘`--no-target-directory`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dno_002dtarget_002ddirectory"></span> <span
id="index-target-directory-1"></span> <span
id="index-destination-directory"></span>

Do not treat the last operand specially when it is a directory or a
symbolic link to a directory. This can help avoid race conditions in
programs that operate in a shared area. For example, when the command
‘`mv /tmp/source /tmp/dest`’ succeeds, there is no guarantee that
`/tmp/source` was renamed to `/tmp/dest`: it could have been renamed to
`/tmp/dest/source` instead, if some other process created `/tmp/dest` as
a directory. However, if `mv -T /tmp/source /tmp/dest` succeeds, there
is no question that `/tmp/source` was renamed to `/tmp/dest`.

In the opposite situation, where you want the last operand to be treated
as a directory and want a diagnostic otherwise, you can use the
`--target-directory` (`-t`) option.

‘`-t directory`’  
‘`--target-directory=directory`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dtarget_002ddirectory"></span> <span
id="index-target-directory-2"></span> <span
id="index-destination-directory-1"></span>

Use `directory` as the directory component of each destination file
name.

The interface for most programs is that after processing options and a
finite (possibly zero) number of fixed-position arguments, the remaining
argument list is either expected to be empty, or is a list of items
(usually files) that will all be handled identically. The `xargs`
program is designed to work well with this convention.

The commands in the `mv`-family are unusual in that they take a variable
number of arguments with a special case at the *end* (namely, the target
directory). This makes it nontrivial to perform some operations, e.g.,
“move all files from here to ../d/”, because `mv * ../d/` might exhaust
the argument space, and `ls | xargs ...` doesn’t have a clean way to
specify an extra final argument for each invocation of the subject
command. (It can be done by going through a shell command, but that
requires more human labor and brain power than it should.)

The `--target-directory` (`-t`) option allows the `cp`, `install`, `ln`,
and `mv` programs to be used conveniently with `xargs`. For example, you
can move the files from the current directory to a sibling directory,
`d` like this:

<div class="example">

``` example
ls | xargs mv -t ../d --
```

</div>

However, this doesn’t move files whose names begin with ‘`.`’. If you
use the GNU `find` program, you can move those files too, with this
command:

<div class="example">

``` example
find . -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 \
  | xargs mv -t ../d
```

</div>

But both of the above approaches fail if there are no files in the
current directory, or if any file has a name containing a blank or some
other special characters. The following example removes those
limitations and requires both GNU `find` and GNU `xargs`:

<div class="example">

``` example
find . -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -print0 \
  | xargs --null --no-run-if-empty \
      mv -t ../d
```

</div>

The `--target-directory` (`-t`) and `--no-target-directory` (`-T`)
options cannot be combined.

### 2.9 Trailing slashes

<span id="index-trailing-slashes"></span>

Some GNU programs (at least `cp` and `mv`) allow you to remove any
trailing slashes from each `source` argument before operating on it. The
`--strip-trailing-slashes` option enables this behavior.

This is useful when a `source` argument may have a trailing slash and
specify a symbolic link to a directory. This scenario is in fact rather
common because some shells can automatically append a trailing slash
when performing file name completion on such symbolic links. Without
this option, `mv`, for example, (via the system’s rename function) must
interpret a trailing slash as a request to dereference the symbolic link
and so must rename the indirectly referenced *directory* and not the
symbolic link. Although it may seem surprising that such behavior be the
default, it is required by POSIX and is consistent with other parts of
that standard.

### 2.10 Traversing symlinks

<span
id="index-symbolic-link-to-directory_002c-controlling-traversal-of"></span>

The following options modify how `chown` and `chgrp` traverse a
hierarchy when the `--recursive` (`-R`) option is also specified. If
more than one of the following options is specified, only the final one
takes effect. These options specify whether processing a symbolic link
to a directory entails operating on just the symbolic link or on all
files in the hierarchy rooted at that directory.

These options are independent of `--dereference` and `--no-dereference`
(`-h`), which control whether to modify a symlink or its referent.

‘`-H`’  
<span id="index-_002dH"></span> <span
id="index-symbolic-link-to-directory_002c-traverse-if-on-the-command-line"></span>

If `--recursive` (`-R`) is specified and a command line argument is a
symbolic link to a directory, traverse it.

‘`-L`’  
<span id="index-_002dL"></span> <span
id="index-symbolic-link-to-directory_002c-traverse-each-that-is-encountered"></span>

In a recursive traversal, traverse every symbolic link to a directory
that is encountered.

‘`-P`’  
<span id="index-_002dP"></span> <span
id="index-symbolic-link-to-directory_002c-never-traverse"></span>

Do not traverse any symbolic links. This is the default if none of `-H`,
`-L`, or `-P` is specified.

### 2.11 Treating `/` specially

Certain commands can operate destructively on entire hierarchies. For
example, if a user with appropriate privileges mistakenly runs
‘`rm -rf / tmp/junk`’, that may remove all files on the entire system.
Since there are so few legitimate uses for such a command, GNU `rm`
normally declines to operate on any directory that resolves to `/`. If
you really want to try to remove all the files on your system, you can
use the `--no-preserve-root` option, but the default behavior, specified
by the `--preserve-root` option, is safer for most purposes.

The commands `chgrp`, `chmod` and `chown` can also operate destructively
on entire hierarchies, so they too support these options. Although,
unlike `rm`, they don’t actually unlink files, these commands are
arguably more dangerous when operating recursively on `/`, since they
often work much more quickly, and hence damage more files before an
alert user can interrupt them. Tradition and POSIX require these
commands to operate recursively on `/`, so they default to
`--no-preserve-root`, but using the `--preserve-root` option makes them
safer for most purposes. For convenience you can specify
`--preserve-root` in an alias or in a shell function.

Note that the `--preserve-root` option also ensures that `chgrp` and
`chown` do not modify `/` even when dereferencing a symlink pointing to
`/`.

### 2.12 Special built-in utilities

Some programs like `nice` can invoke other programs; for example, the
command ‘`nice cat file`’ invokes the program `cat` by executing the
command ‘`cat file`’. However, *special built-in utilities* like `exit`
cannot be invoked this way. For example, the command ‘`nice exit`’ does
not have a well-defined behavior: it may generate an error message
instead of exiting.

Here is a list of the special built-in utilities that are standardized
by POSIX 1003.1-2004.

> . : break continue eval exec exit export readonly return set shift
> times trap unset

For example, because ‘`.`’, ‘`:`’, and ‘`exec`’ are special, the
commands ‘`nice . foo.sh`’, ‘`nice :`’, and ‘`nice exec pwd`’ do not
work as you might expect.

Many shells extend this list. For example, Bash has several extra
special built-in utilities like `history`, and `suspend`, and with Bash
the command ‘`nice suspend`’ generates an error message instead of
suspending.

### 2.13 Standards conformance

<span id="index-POSIXLY_005fCORRECT-1"></span>

In a few cases, the GNU utilities’ default behavior is incompatible with
the POSIX standard. To suppress these incompatibilities, define the
`POSIXLY_CORRECT` environment variable. Unless you are checking for
POSIX conformance, you probably do not need to define `POSIXLY_CORRECT`.

Newer versions of POSIX are occasionally incompatible with older
versions. For example, older versions of POSIX required the command
‘`sort +1`’ to sort based on the second and succeeding fields in each
input line, but in POSIX 1003.1-2001 the same command is required to
sort the file named `+1`, and you must instead use the command
‘`sort -k 2`’ to get the field-based sort. To complicate things further,
POSIX 1003.1-2008 allows an implementation to have either the old or the
new behavior.

<span id="index-_005fPOSIX2_005fVERSION"></span>

The GNU utilities normally conform to the version of POSIX that is
standard for your system. To cause them to conform to a different
version of POSIX, define the `_POSIX2_VERSION` environment variable to a
value of the form `yyyymm` specifying the year and month the standard
was adopted. Three values are currently supported for `_POSIX2_VERSION`:
‘`199209`’ stands for POSIX 1003.2-1992, ‘`200112`’ stands for POSIX
1003.1-2001, and ‘`200809`’ stands for POSIX 1003.1-2008. For example,
if you have a POSIX 1003.1-2001 system but are running software
containing traditional usage like ‘`sort +1`’ or ‘`tail +10`’, you can
work around the compatibility problems by setting
‘`_POSIX2_VERSION=200809`’ in your environment.

`cat` copies each `file` (‘`-`’ means standard input), or standard input
if none are given, to standard output. Synopsis:

<div class="example">

‘`-A`’  
‘`--show-all`’  
<span id="index-_002dA"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dshow_002dall"></span>

‘`--number-nonblank`’  
<span id="index-_002db-1"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dnumber_002dnonblank"></span>

Number all nonempty output lines, starting with 1.

‘`-e`’  
<span id="index-_002de"></span>

Equivalent to `-vE`.

‘`-E`’  
‘`--show-ends`’  
<span id="index-_002dE"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dshow_002dends"></span>

shown as ‘`^M$`’.

‘`-n`’  
‘`--number`’  
<span id="index-_002dn"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dnumber"></span>

Number all output lines, starting with 1. This option is ignored if `-b`
is in effect.

‘`-s`’  
‘`--squeeze-blank`’  
<span id="index-_002ds"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dsqueeze_002dblank"></span> <span
id="index-squeezing-empty-lines"></span> <span
id="index-squeezing-blank-lines"></span>

‘`-t`’  
<span id="index-_002dt"></span>

Equivalent to `-vT`.

‘`-T`’  
‘`--show-tabs`’  
<span id="index-_002dT"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dshow_002dtabs"></span>

Display TAB characters as ‘`^I`’.

‘`-u`’  
<span id="index-_002du"></span>

Ignored; for POSIX compatibility.

‘`-v`’  
‘`--show-nonprinting`’  
<span id="index-_002dv"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dshow_002dnonprinting"></span>

Display control characters except for LFD and TAB using ‘`^`’ notation
and precede characters that have the high bit set with ‘`M-`’.

On systems like MS-DOS that distinguish between text and binary files,
`cat` normally reads and writes in binary mode. However, `cat` reads in
text mode if one of the options `-bensAE` is used or if `cat` is reading
from standard input and standard input is a terminal. Similarly, `cat`
writes in text mode if one of the options `-bensAE` is used or if
standard output is a terminal.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

Examples:

<div class="example">

``` example
# Output f's contents, then standard input, then g's contents.
cat f - g

# Copy standard input to standard output.
cat

### 3.2 `tac`: Concatenate and write files in reverse

<span id="index-tac"></span> <span id="index-reversing-files"></span>

`tac` copies each `file` (‘`-`’ means standard input), or standard input
if none are given, to standard output, reversing the records (lines by
default) in each separately. Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
tac [option]… [file]…
```

</div>

*Records* are separated by instances of a string (newline by default).
By default, this separator string is attached to the end of the record
that it follows in the file.

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`-b`’  
‘`--before`’  
<span id="index-_002db-2"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dbefore"></span>

The separator is attached to the beginning of the record that it
precedes in the file.

‘`-r`’  
‘`--regex`’  
<span id="index-_002dr"></span> <span id="index-_002d_002dregex"></span>

Treat the separator string as a regular expression.

‘`-s separator`’  
‘`--separator=separator`’  
<span id="index-_002ds-1"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dseparator"></span>

Use `separator` as the record separator, instead of newline. Note an
empty `separator` is treated as a zero byte. I.e., input and output
items are delimited with ASCII NUL.

On systems like MS-DOS that distinguish between text and binary files,
`tac` reads and writes in binary mode.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

Example:

<div class="example">

``` example
# Reverse a file character by character.
tac -r -s 'x\|[^x]'
```

### 3.3 `nl`: Number lines and write files

<span id="index-nl-1"></span> <span id="index-numbering-lines"></span>
<span id="index-line-numbering"></span>

`nl` writes each `file` (‘`-`’ means standard input), or standard input
if none are given, to standard output, with line numbers added to some
or all of the lines. Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
nl [option]… [file]…
```

</div>

<span id="index-logical-pages_002c-numbering-on"></span>

`nl` decomposes its input into (logical) page sections; by default, the
line number is reset to 1 at each logical page section. `nl` treats all
of the input files as a single document; it does not reset line numbers
or logical pages between files.

<span id="index-headers_002c-numbering"></span> <span
id="index-body_002c-numbering"></span> <span
id="index-footers_002c-numbering"></span>

A logical page consists of three sections: header, body, and footer. Any
of the sections can be empty. Each can be numbered in a different style
from the others.

The beginnings of the sections of logical pages are indicated in the
input file by a line containing exactly one of these delimiter strings:

‘`\:\:\:`’  
start of header;

‘`\:\:`’  
start of body;

‘`\:`’  
start of footer.

The characters from which these strings are made can be changed from
‘`\`’ and ‘`:`’ via options (see below), but the pattern of each string
cannot be changed.

A section delimiter is replaced by an empty line on output. Any text
that comes before the first section delimiter string in the input file
is considered to be part of a body section, so `nl` treats a file that
contains no section delimiters as a single body section.

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`-b style`’  
‘`--body-numbering=style`’  
<span id="index-_002db-3"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dbody_002dnumbering"></span>

Select the numbering style for lines in the body section of each logical
page. When a line is not numbered, the current line number is not
incremented, but the line number separator character is still prepended
to the line. The styles are:

‘`a`’  
number all lines,

‘`t`’  
number only nonempty lines (default for body),

‘`n`’  
do not number lines (default for header and footer),

‘`pbre`’  
number only lines that contain a match for the basic regular expression
`bre`. See [Regular
Expressions](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/manual/grep.html#Regular-Expressions)
in The GNU Grep Manual.

‘`-d cd`’  
‘`--section-delimiter=cd`’  
<span id="index-_002dd"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dsection_002ddelimiter"></span> <span
id="index-section-delimiters-of-pages"></span>

Set the section delimiter characters to `cd`; default is ‘`\:`’. If only
`c` is given, the second remains ‘`:`’. As a GNU extension more than two
characters can be specified, and also if `cd` is empty (`-d ''`), then
section matching is disabled. (Remember to protect ‘`\`’ or other
metacharacters from shell expansion with quotes or extra backslashes.)

‘`-f style`’  
‘`--footer-numbering=style`’  
<span id="index-_002df"></span> <span

‘`--line-increment=number`’  
<span id="index-_002di"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dline_002dincrement"></span>

Increment line numbers by `number` (default 1). `number` can be negative
to decrement.

‘`-l number`’  
‘`--join-blank-lines=number`’  
<span id="index-_002dl"></span> <span

id="index-empty-lines_002c-numbering"></span> <span
id="index-blank-lines_002c-numbering"></span>

Consider `number` (default 1) consecutive empty lines to be one logical
line for numbering, and only number the last one. Where fewer than
`number` consecutive empty lines occur, do not number them. An empty
line is one that contains no characters, not even spaces or tabs.

‘`-n format`’  
‘`--number-format=format`’  
<span id="index-_002dn-1"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dnumber_002dformat"></span>

Select the line numbering format (default is `rn`):

‘`ln`’  
<span id="index-ln-format-for-nl"></span>

left justified, no leading zeros;

‘`rn`’  
<span id="index-rn-format-for-nl"></span>

right justified, no leading zeros;

‘`rz`’  
<span id="index-rz-format-for-nl"></span>

right justified, leading zeros.

Separate the line number from the text line in the output with `string`
(default is the TAB character).

‘`-v number`’  
‘`--starting-line-number=number`’  
<span id="index-_002dv-1"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dstarting_002dline_002dnumber"></span>

Set the initial line number on each logical page to `number` (default
1). The starting `number` can be negative.

‘`-w number`’  
‘`--number-width=number`’  
<span id="index-_002dw"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dnumber_002dwidth"></span>

Use `number` characters for line numbers (default 6).

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

<span id="od_003a-Write-files-in-octal-or-other-formats"></span>

### 3.4 `od`: Write files in octal or other formats

<span id="index-od"></span> <span id="index-octal-dump-of-files"></span>
<span id="index-hex-dump-of-files"></span> <span
id="index-ASCII-dump-of-files"></span> <span
id="index-file-contents_002c-dumping-unambiguously"></span>

`od` writes an unambiguous representation of each `file` (‘`-`’ means
standard input), or standard input if none are given. Synopses:

<div class="example">

``` example
od [option]… [file]…
od [-abcdfilosx]… [file] [[+]offset[.][b]]
od [option]… --traditional [file] [[+]offset[.][b] [[+]label[.][b]]]
```

</div>

Each line of output consists of the offset in the input, followed by
groups of data from the file. By default, `od` prints the offset in
octal, and each group of file data is a C `short int`’s worth of input
printed as a single octal number.

If `offset` is given, it specifies how many input bytes to skip before
formatting and writing. By default, it is interpreted as an octal
number, but the optional trailing decimal point causes it to be
interpreted as decimal. If no decimal is specified and the offset begins
with ‘`0x`’ or ‘`0X`’ it is interpreted as a hexadecimal number. If
there is a trailing ‘`b`’, the number of bytes skipped will be `offset`
multiplied by 512.

If a command is of both the first and second forms, the second form is
assumed if the last operand begins with ‘`+`’ or (if there are two
operands) a digit. For example, in ‘`od foo 10`’ and ‘`od +10`’ the
‘`10`’ is an offset, whereas in ‘`od 10`’ the ‘`10`’ is a file name.

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`-A radix`’  
‘`--address-radix=radix`’  
<span id="index-_002dA-1"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002daddress_002dradix"></span> <span
id="index-radix-for-file-offsets"></span> <span
id="index-file-offset-radix"></span>

Select the base in which file offsets are printed. `radix` can be one of
the following:

‘`d`’  
decimal;

‘`o`’  
octal;

‘`x`’  
hexadecimal;

‘`n`’  
none (do not print offsets).

The default is octal.

‘`--endian=order`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dendian"></span> <span
id="index-byte_002dswapping"></span> <span id="index-endianness"></span>

Reorder input bytes, to handle inputs with differing byte orders, or to
provide consistent output independent of the endian convention of the
current system. Swapping is performed according to the specified
`--type` size and endian `order`, which can be ‘`little`’ or ‘`big`’.

‘`-j bytes`’  
‘`--skip-bytes=bytes`’  
<span id="index-_002dj"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dskip_002dbytes"></span>

Skip `bytes` input bytes before formatting and writing. If `bytes`
begins with ‘`0x`’ or ‘`0X`’, it is interpreted in hexadecimal;
otherwise, if it begins with ‘`0`’, in octal; otherwise, in decimal.
`bytes` may be, or may be an integer optionally followed by, one of the
following multiplicative suffixes:

<div class="example">

``` example
‘b’  =>            512 ("blocks")
‘KB’ =>           1000 (KiloBytes)
‘K’  =>           1024 (KibiBytes)
‘MB’ =>      1000*1000 (MegaBytes)
‘M’  =>      1024*1024 (MebiBytes)
‘GB’ => 1000*1000*1000 (GigaBytes)
‘G’  => 1024*1024*1024 (GibiBytes)
```

</div>

and so on for ‘`T`’, ‘`P`’, ‘`E`’, ‘`Z`’, and ‘`Y`’. Binary prefixes can
be used, too: ‘`KiB`’=‘`K`’, ‘`MiB`’=‘`M`’, and so on.

‘`-N bytes`’  
‘`--read-bytes=bytes`’  
<span id="index-_002dN"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dread_002dbytes"></span>

Output at most `bytes` bytes of the input. Prefixes and suffixes on
`bytes` are interpreted as for the `-j` option.

‘`-S bytes`’  
‘`--strings[=bytes]`’  
<span id="index-_002dS-1"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dstrings"></span> <span
id="index-string-constants_002c-outputting"></span>

Instead of the normal output, output only *string constants*: at least
`bytes` consecutive ASCII graphic characters, followed by a zero byte
(ASCII NUL). Prefixes and suffixes on `bytes` are interpreted as for the
`-j` option.

If `bytes` is omitted with `--strings`, the default is 3.

‘`-t type`’  
‘`--format=type`’  
<span id="index-_002dt-1"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dformat"></span>

Select the format in which to output the file data. `type` is a string
of one or more of the below type indicator characters. If you include
more than one type indicator character in a single `type` string, or use
this option more than once, `od` writes one copy of each output line
using each of the data types that you specified, in the order that you
specified.

Adding a trailing “z” to any type specification appends a display of the
single byte character representation of the printable characters to the
output line generated by the type specification.

‘`a`’  
named character, ignoring high-order bit

‘`c`’  
printable single byte character, C backslash escape or a 3 digit octal
sequence

‘`d`’  
signed decimal

‘`f`’  
floating point (see [Floating point](#Floating-point))

‘`o`’  
octal

‘`u`’  
unsigned decimal

‘`x`’  
hexadecimal

The type `a` outputs things like ‘`sp`’ for space, ‘`nl`’ for newline,
and ‘`nul`’ for a zero byte. Only the least significant seven bits of
each byte is used; the high-order bit is ignored. Type `c` outputs
‘` `’, ‘`\n`’, and `\0`, respectively.

<span id="index-type-size"></span>

Except for types ‘`a`’ and ‘`c`’, you can specify the number of bytes to
use in interpreting each number in the given data type by following the
type indicator character with a decimal integer. Alternately, you can
specify the size of one of the C compiler’s built-in data types by
following the type indicator character with one of the following
characters. For integers (‘`d`’, ‘`o`’, ‘`u`’, ‘`x`’):

‘`C`’  
char

‘`S`’  
short

‘`I`’  
int

‘`L`’  
long

For floating point (`f`):

F  
float

D  
double

L  
long double

‘`-v`’  
‘`--output-duplicates`’  
<span id="index-_002dv-2"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002doutput_002dduplicates"></span>

Output consecutive lines that are identical. By default, when two or
more consecutive output lines would be identical, `od` outputs only the
first line, and puts just an asterisk on the following line to indicate
the elision.

‘`-w[n]`’  
‘`--width[=n]`’  
<span id="index-_002dw-1"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dwidth"></span>

Dump `n` input bytes per output line. This must be a multiple of the
least common multiple of the sizes associated with the specified output
types.

If this option is not given at all, the default is 16. If `n` is
omitted, the default is 32.

The next several options are shorthands for format specifications. GNU
`od` accepts any combination of shorthands and format specification
options. These options accumulate.

‘`-a`’  
<span id="index-_002da"></span>

Output as named characters. Equivalent to ‘`-t a`’.

‘`-b`’  
<span id="index-_002db-4"></span>

Output as octal bytes. Equivalent to ‘`-t o1`’.

‘`-c`’  
<span id="index-_002dc"></span>

Output as printable single byte characters, C backslash escapes or 3
digit octal sequences. Equivalent to ‘`-t c`’.

‘`-d`’  
<span id="index-_002dd-1"></span>

Output as unsigned decimal two-byte units. Equivalent to ‘`-t u2`’.

‘`-f`’  
<span id="index-_002df-1"></span>

Output as floats. Equivalent to ‘`-t fF`’.

‘`-i`’  
<span id="index-_002di-1"></span>

Output as decimal ints. Equivalent to ‘`-t dI`’.

‘`-l`’  
<span id="index-_002dl-1"></span>

Output as decimal long ints. Equivalent to ‘`-t dL`’.

‘`-o`’  
<span id="index-_002do"></span>

Output as octal two-byte units. Equivalent to `-t o2`.

‘`-s`’  
<span id="index-_002ds-3"></span>

Output as decimal two-byte units. Equivalent to `-t d2`.

‘`-x`’  
<span id="index-_002dx"></span>

Output as hexadecimal two-byte units. Equivalent to ‘`-t x2`’.

‘`--traditional`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dtraditional"></span>

Recognize the non-option label argument that traditional `od` accepted.
The following syntax:

<div class="example">

``` example
od --traditional [file] [[+]offset[.][b] [[+]label[.][b]]]
```

</div>

can be used to specify at most one file and optional arguments
specifying an offset and a pseudo-start address, `label`. The `label`
argument is interpreted just like `offset`, but it specifies an initial
pseudo-address. The pseudo-addresses are displayed in parentheses
following any normal address.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

### 3.5 `base32`: Transform data into printable data

<span id="index-base32"></span> <span id="index-base32-encoding"></span>

`base32` transforms data read from a file, or standard input, into (or
from) base32 encoded form. The base32 encoded form uses printable ASCII
characters to represent binary data. The usage and options of this
command are precisely the same as for `base64`. See [base64
invocation](#base64-invocation).

### 3.6 `base64`: Transform data into printable data

<span id="index-base64"></span> <span id="index-base64-encoding"></span>

`base64` transforms data read from a file, or standard input, into (or
from) base64 encoded form. The base64 encoded form uses printable ASCII
characters to represent binary data. Synopses:

<div class="example">

``` example
base64 [option]… [file]
base64 --decode [option]… [file]
```

</div>

The base64 encoding expands data to roughly 133% of the original. The
base32 encoding expands data to roughly 160% of the original. The format
conforms to [RFC 4648](https://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc4648).

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`-w cols`’  
‘`--wrap=cols`’  
<span id="index-_002dw-2"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dwrap"></span> <span id="index-wrap-data"></span>
<span id="index-column-to-wrap-data-after"></span>

During encoding, wrap lines after `cols` characters. This must be a
positive number.

The default is to wrap after 76 characters. Use the value 0 to disable
line wrapping altogether.

‘`-d`’  
‘`--decode`’  
<span id="index-_002dd-2"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002ddecode"></span> <span
id="index-Decode-base64-data"></span> <span
id="index-Base64-decoding"></span>

Change the mode of operation, from the default of encoding data, to
decoding data. Input is expected to be base64 encoded data, and the
output will be the original data.

‘`-i`’  
‘`--ignore-garbage`’  
<span id="index-_002di-2"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dignore_002dgarbage"></span> <span
id="index-Ignore-garbage-in-base64-stream"></span>

When decoding, newlines are always accepted. During decoding, ignore
unrecognized bytes, to permit distorted data to be decoded.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

### 3.7 `basenc`: Transform data into printable data

<span id="index-basenc"></span> <span
id="index-base32-encoding-1"></span>

`basenc` transforms data read from a file, or standard input, into (or
from) various common encoding forms. The encoded form uses printable
ASCII characters to represent binary data.

Synopses:

<div class="example">

``` example
basenc encoding [option]… [file]
basenc encoding --decode [option]… [file]
```

</div>

The `encoding` argument is required. If `file` is omitted, `basenc`
reads from standard input. The `-w/--wrap`,`-i/--ignore-garbage`,
`-d/--decode` options of this command are precisely the same as for
`base64`. See [base64 invocation](#base64-invocation).

Supported `encoding`s are:

‘`--base64`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dbase64"></span>

Encode into (or decode from with `-d/--decode`) base64 form. The format
conforms to [RFC
4648#4](https://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc4648#section-4). Equivalent to
the `base64` command.

‘`--base64url`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dbase64url"></span>

Encode into (or decode from with `-d/--decode`) file-and-url-safe base64
form (using ‘`_`’ and ‘`-`’ instead of ‘`+`’ and ‘`/`’). The format
conforms to [RFC
4648#5](https://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc4648#section-5).

‘`--base32`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dbase32"></span>

Encode into (or decode from with `-d/--decode`) base32 form. The encoded
data uses the ‘`ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ234567=`’ characters. The
format conforms to [RFC
4648#6](https://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc4648#section-6). Equivalent to
the `base32` command.

‘`--base32hex`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dbase32hex"></span>

Encode into (or decode from with `-d/--decode`) Extended Hex Alphabet
base32 form. The encoded data uses the
‘`0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUV=`’ characters. The format conforms to
[RFC 4648#7](https://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc4648#section-7).

‘`--base16`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dbase16"></span>

Encode into (or decode from with `-d/--decode`) base16 (hexadecimal)
form. The encoded data uses the ‘`0123456789ABCDEF`’ characters. The
format conforms to [RFC
4648#8](https://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc4648#section-8).

‘`--base2lsbf`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dbase2lsbf"></span>

Encode into (or decode from with `-d/--decode`) binary string form
(‘`0`’ and ‘`1`’) with the *least* significant bit of every byte first.

‘`--base2msbf`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dbase2msbf"></span>

Encode into (or decode from with `-d/--decode`) binary string form
(‘`0`’ and ‘`1`’) with the *most* significant bit of every byte first.

‘`--z85`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dz85"></span>

Encode into (or decode from with `-d/--decode`) Z85 form (a modified
Ascii85 form). The encoded data uses the
‘`0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTU VWXYZ.-:+=^!/*?&<>()[]{}@%$#`’.
characters. The format conforms to [ZeroMQ
spec:32/Z85](https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:32/Z85/).

When encoding with `--z85`, input length must be a multiple of 4; when
decoding with `--z85`, input length must be a multiple of 5.

Encoding/decoding examples:

<div class="example">

id="index-reformatting-paragraph-text"></span> <span
id="index-paragraphs_002c-reformatting"></span> <span
id="index-text_002c-reformatting"></span>

`fmt` fills and joins lines to produce output lines of (at most) a given
number of characters (75 by default). Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
fmt [option]… [file]…
```

`fmt` reads from the specified `file` arguments (or standard input if
none are given), and writes to standard output.

By default, blank lines, spaces between words, and indentation are
preserved in the output; successive input lines with different
indentation are not joined; tabs are expanded on input and introduced on
output.

id="index-Plass_002c-Michael-F_002e"></span>

`fmt` prefers breaking lines at the end of a sentence, and tries to
avoid line breaks after the first word of a sentence or before the last
word of a sentence. A *sentence break* is defined as either the end of a
paragraph or a word ending in any of ‘`.?!`’, followed by two spaces or
end of line, ignoring any intervening parentheses or quotes. Like TeX,
`fmt` reads entire “paragraphs” before choosing line breaks; the
algorithm is a variant of that given by Donald E. Knuth and Michael F.
Plass in “Breaking Paragraphs Into Lines”, Software—Practice &
Experience **11**, 11 (November 1981), 1119–1184.

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`-c`’  
‘`--crown-margin`’  
<span id="index-_002dc-1"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dcrown_002dmargin"></span> <span
id="index-crown-margin"></span>

*Crown margin* mode: preserve the indentation of the first two lines
within a paragraph, and align the left margin of each subsequent line
with that of the second line.

‘`-t`’  
‘`--tagged-paragraph`’  
<span id="index-_002dt-2"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dtagged_002dparagraph"></span> <span
id="index-tagged-paragraphs"></span>

*Tagged paragraph* mode: like crown margin mode, except that if
indentation of the first line of a paragraph is the same as the
indentation of the second, the first line is treated as a one-line
paragraph.

‘`-s`’  
‘`--split-only`’  
<span id="index-_002ds-4"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dsplit_002donly"></span>

Split lines only. Do not join short lines to form longer ones. This
prevents sample lines of code, and other such “formatted” text from
being unduly combined.

‘`-u`’  
‘`--uniform-spacing`’  
<span id="index-_002du-1"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002duniform_002dspacing"></span>

Uniform spacing. Reduce spacing between words to one space, and spacing
between sentences to two spaces.

‘`-width`’  
‘`-w width`’  
‘`--width=width`’  
<span id="index-_002dwidth"></span> <span id="index-_002dw-3"></span>
<span id="index-_002d_002dwidth-1"></span>

Fill output lines up to `width` characters (default 75 or `goal` plus
10, if `goal` is provided).

‘`-g goal`’  
‘`--goal=goal`’  
<span id="index-_002dg"></span> <span id="index-_002d_002dgoal"></span>

`fmt` initially tries to make lines `goal` characters wide. By default,
this is 7% shorter than `width`.

‘`-p prefix`’  
‘`--prefix=prefix`’  
Only lines beginning with `prefix` (possibly preceded by whitespace) are
subject to formatting. The prefix and any preceding whitespace are
stripped for the formatting and then re-attached to each formatted
output line. One use is to format certain kinds of program comments,
while leaving the code unchanged.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

### 4.2 `pr`: Paginate or columnate files for printing

<span id="index-pr"></span> <span
id="index-printing_002c-preparing-files-for"></span> <span
id="index-multicolumn-output_002c-generating"></span> <span
id="index-merging-files-in-parallel"></span>

`pr` writes each `file` (‘`-`’ means standard input), or standard input
if none are given, to standard output, paginating and optionally
outputting in multicolumn format; optionally merges all `file`s,
printing all in parallel, one per column. Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
pr [option]… [file]…
```

</div>

<span id="index-LC_005fMESSAGES"></span>

By default, a 5-line header is printed at each page: two blank lines; a
line with the date, the file name, and the page count; and two more
blank lines. A footer of five blank lines is also printed. The default
`page_length` is 66 lines. The default number of text lines is therefore
56. The text line of the header takes the form ‘`date string page`’,
with spaces inserted around `string` so that the line takes up the full
`page_width`. Here, `date` is the date (see the `-D` or `--date-format`
option for details), `string` is the centered header string, and `page`
identifies the page number. The `LC_MESSAGES` locale category affects
the spelling of `page`; in the default C locale, it is ‘`Page number`’
where `number` is the decimal page number.

Form feeds in the input cause page breaks in the output. Multiple form
feeds produce empty pages.

Columns are of equal width, separated by an optional string (default is
‘`space`’). For multicolumn output, lines will always be truncated to
`page_width` (default 72), unless you use the `-J` option. For single
column output no line truncation occurs by default. Use `-W` option to
truncate lines in that case.

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`+first_page[:last_page]`’  
‘`--pages=first_page[:last_page]`’  
<span id="index-_002bpage_005frange"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dpages_003dpage_005frange"></span>

Begin printing with page `first_page` and stop with `last_page`. Missing
‘`:last_page`’ implies end of file. While estimating the number of
skipped pages each form feed in the input file results in a new page.
Page counting with and without ‘`+first_page`’ is identical. By default,
counting starts with the first page of input file (not first page
printed). Line numbering may be altered by `-N` option.

‘`-column`’  
‘`--columns=column`’  
<span id="index-_002dcolumn"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dcolumns"></span> <span
id="index-down-columns"></span>

With each single `file`, produce `column` columns of output (default
is 1) and print columns down, unless `-a` is used. The column width is
automatically decreased as `column` increases; unless you use the
`-W/-w` option to increase `page_width` as well. This option might well
cause some lines to be truncated. The number of lines in the columns on
each page are balanced. The options `-e` and `-i` are on for multiple
text-column output. Together with `-J` option column alignment and line
truncation is turned off. Lines of full length are joined in a free
field format and `-S` option may set field separators. `-column` may not
be used with `-m` option.

‘`-a`’  
‘`--across`’  
<span id="index-_002da-1"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dacross"></span> <span
id="index-across-columns"></span>

With each single `file`, print columns across rather than down. The
`-column` option must be given with `column` greater than one. If a line
is too long to fit in a column, it is truncated.

‘`-c`’  
‘`--show-control-chars`’  
<span id="index-_002dc-2"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dshow_002dcontrol_002dchars"></span>

Print control characters using hat notation (e.g., ‘`^G`’); print other
nonprinting characters in octal backslash notation. By default,
nonprinting characters are not changed.

‘`-d`’  
‘`--double-space`’  
<span id="index-_002dd-3"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002ddouble_002dspace"></span> <span
id="index-double-spacing"></span>

Double space the output.

‘`-D format`’  
‘`--date-format=format`’  
<span id="index-time-formats"></span> <span
id="index-formatting-times"></span>

Format header dates using `format`, using the same conventions as for
the command ‘`date +format`’. See [date invocation](#date-invocation).
Except for directives, which start with ‘`%`’, characters in `format`
are printed unchanged. You can use this option to specify an arbitrary
string in place of the header date, e.g.,
`--date-format="Monday morning"`.

<span id="index-POSIXLY_005fCORRECT-2"></span> <span
id="index-LC_005fTIME"></span>

The default date format is ‘`%Y-%m-%d %H:%M`’ (for example,
‘`2020-07-09 23:59`’); but if the `POSIXLY_CORRECT` environment variable
is set and the `LC_TIME` locale category specifies the POSIX locale, the
default is ‘`%b %e %H:%M %Y`’ (for example, ‘`Jul  9 23:59 2020`’.

<span id="index-TZ"></span>

Timestamps are listed according to the time zone rules specified by the
`TZ` environment variable, or by the system default rules if `TZ` is not
set. See [Specifying the Time Zone with
`TZ`](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_mono/libc.html#TZ-Variable)
in The GNU C Library Reference Manual.

‘`-e[in-tabchar[in-tabwidth]]`’  
‘`--expand-tabs[=in-tabchar[in-tabwidth]]`’  
<span id="index-_002de-1"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dexpand_002dtabs"></span> <span
id="index-input-tabs"></span>

Expand `tab`s to spaces on input. Optional argument `in-tabchar` is the
input tab character (default is the TAB character). Second optional
argument `in-tabwidth` is the input tab character’s width (default is
8).

‘`-f`’  
‘`-F`’  
‘`--form-feed`’  
<span id="index-_002dF"></span> <span id="index-_002df-2"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dform_002dfeed"></span>

Use a form feed instead of newlines to separate output pages. This does
not alter the default page length of 66 lines.

‘`-h header`’  
‘`--header=header`’  
<span id="index-_002dh-2"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dheader"></span>

Replace the file name in the header with the centered string `header`.
When using the shell, `header` should be quoted and should be separated
from `-h` by a space.

‘`-i[out-tabchar[out-tabwidth]]`’  
‘`--output-tabs[=out-tabchar[out-tabwidth]]`’  
<span id="index-_002di-3"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002doutput_002dtabs"></span> <span
id="index-output-tabs"></span>

Replace spaces with `tab`s on output. Optional argument `out-tabchar` is
the output tab character (default is the TAB character). Second optional
argument `out-tabwidth` is the output tab character’s width (default is
8).

‘`-J`’  
‘`--join-lines`’  
<span id="index-_002dJ"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002djoin_002dlines"></span>

Merge lines of full length. Used together with the column options
`-column`, `-a -column` or `-m`. Turns off `-W/-w` line truncation; no
column alignment used; may be used with `--sep-string[=string]`. `-J`
has been introduced (together with `-W` and `--sep-string`) to
disentangle the old (POSIX-compliant) options `-w` and `-s` along with
the three column options.

‘`-l page_length`’  
‘`--length=page_length`’  
<span id="index-_002dl-2"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dlength"></span>

Set the page length to `page_length` (default 66) lines, including the
lines of the header \[and the footer\]. If `page_length` is less than or
equal to 10, the header and footer are omitted, as if the `-t` option
had been given.

‘`-m`’  
‘`--merge`’  
<span id="index-_002dm"></span> <span id="index-_002d_002dmerge"></span>

Merge and print all `file`s in parallel, one in each column. If a line
is too long to fit in a column, it is truncated, unless the `-J` option
is used. `--sep-string[=string]` may be used. Empty pages in some
`file`s (form feeds set) produce empty columns, still marked by
`string`. The result is a continuous line numbering and column marking
throughout the whole merged file. Completely empty merged pages show no
separators or line numbers. The default header becomes ‘`date page`’
with spaces inserted in the middle; this may be used with the `-h` or
`--header` option to fill up the middle blank part.

‘`-n[number-separator[digits]]`’  
‘`--number-lines[=number-separator[digits]]`’  
<span id="index-_002dn-2"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dnumber_002dlines"></span>

Provide `digits` digit line numbering (default for `digits` is 5). With
multicolumn output the number occupies the first `digits` column
positions of each text column or only each line of `-m` output. With
single column output the number precedes each line just as `-m` does.
Default counting of the line numbers starts with the first line of the
input file (not the first line printed, compare the `--page` option and
`-N` option). Optional argument `number-separator` is the character
appended to the line number to separate it from the text followed. The
default separator is the TAB character. In a strict sense a TAB is
always printed with single column output only. The TAB width varies with
the TAB position, e.g., with the left `margin` specified by `-o` option.
With multicolumn output priority is given to
‘`equal width of output columns`’ (a POSIX specification). The TAB width
is fixed to the value of the first column and does not change with
different values of left `margin`. That means a fixed number of spaces
is always printed in the place of the `number-separator` TAB. The
tabification depends upon the output position.

‘`-N line_number`’  
‘`--first-line-number=line_number`’  
<span id="index-_002dN-1"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dfirst_002dline_002dnumber"></span>

Start line counting with the number `line_number` at first line of first
page printed (in most cases not the first line of the input file).

‘`-o margin`’  
‘`--indent=margin`’  
<span id="index-_002do-1"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dindent"></span> <span
id="index-indenting-lines"></span> <span id="index-left-margin"></span>

Indent each line with a margin `margin` spaces wide (default is zero).
The total page width is the size of the margin plus the `page_width` set
with the `-W/-w` option. A limited overflow may occur with numbered
single column output (compare `-n` option).

‘`-r`’  
‘`--no-file-warnings`’  
<span id="index-_002dr-1"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dno_002dfile_002dwarnings"></span>

Do not print a warning message when an argument `file` cannot be opened.
(The exit status will still be nonzero, however.)

‘`-s[char]`’  
‘`--separator[=char]`’  
<span id="index-_002ds-5"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dseparator-1"></span>

Separate columns by a single character `char`. The default for `char` is
the TAB character without `-w` and ‘`no character`’ with `-w`. Without
`-s` the default separator ‘`space`’ is set. `-s[char]` turns off line
truncation of all three column options (`-COLUMN`\|`-a -COLUMN`\|`-m`)
unless `-w` is set. This is a POSIX-compliant formulation.

‘`-S[string]`’  
‘`--sep-string[=string]`’  
<span id="index-_002dS-2"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dsep_002dstring"></span>

Use `string` to separate output columns. The `-S` option doesn’t affect
the `-W/-w` option, unlike the `-s` option which does. It does not
affect line truncation or column alignment. Without `-S`, and with `-J`,
`pr` uses the default output separator, TAB. Without `-S` or `-J`, `pr`
uses a ‘`space`’ (same as `-S" "`). If no ‘`string`’ argument is
specified, ‘`""`’ is assumed.

‘`-t`’  
‘`--omit-header`’  
<span id="index-_002dt-3"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002domit_002dheader"></span>

Do not print the usual header \[and footer\] on each page, and do not
fill out the bottom of pages (with blank lines or a form feed). No page
structure is produced, but form feeds set in the input files are
retained. The predefined pagination is not changed. `-t` or `-T` may be
useful together with other options; e.g.: `-t -e4`, expand TAB
characters in the input file to 4 spaces but don’t make any other
changes. Use of `-t` overrides `-h`.

‘`-T`’  
‘`--omit-pagination`’  
<span id="index-_002dT-1"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002domit_002dpagination"></span>

Do not print header \[and footer\]. In addition eliminate all form feeds
set in the input files.

‘`-v`’  
‘`--show-nonprinting`’  
<span id="index-_002dv-3"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dshow_002dnonprinting-1"></span>

Print nonprinting characters in octal backslash notation.

‘`-w page_width`’  
‘`--width=page_width`’  
<span id="index-_002dw-4"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dwidth-2"></span>

Set page width to `page_width` characters for multiple text-column
output only (default for `page_width` is 72). The specified `page_width`
is rounded down so that columns have equal width. `-s[CHAR]` turns off
the default page width and any line truncation and column alignment.
Lines of full length are merged, regardless of the column options set.
No `page_width` setting is possible with single column output. A
POSIX-compliant formulation.

‘`-W page_width`’  
‘`--page_width=page_width`’  
<span id="index-_002dW"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dpage_005fwidth"></span>

Set the page width to `page_width` characters, honored with and without
a column option. With a column option, the specified `page_width` is
rounded down so that columns have equal width. Text lines are truncated,
unless `-J` is used. Together with one of the three column options
(`-column`, `-a -column` or `-m`) column alignment is always used. The
separator options `-S` or `-s` don’t disable the `-W` option. Default is
72 characters. Without `-W page_width` and without any of the column
options NO line truncation is used (defined to keep downward
compatibility and to meet most frequent tasks). That’s equivalent to
`-W 72 -J`. The header line is never truncated.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

### 4.3 `fold`: Wrap input lines to fit in specified width

<span id="index-fold"></span> <span
id="index-wrapping-long-input-lines"></span> <span
id="index-folding-long-input-lines"></span>

`fold` writes each `file` (`-` means standard input), or standard input
if none are given, to standard output, breaking long lines. Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
fold [option]… [file]…
```

</div>

By default, `fold` breaks lines wider than 80 columns. The output is
split into as many lines as necessary.

<span id="index-screen-columns"></span>

`fold` counts screen columns by default; thus, a tab may count more than
one column, backspace decreases the column count, and carriage return
sets the column to zero.

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`-b`’  
‘`--bytes`’  
<span id="index-_002db-5"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dbytes"></span>

Count bytes rather than columns, so that tabs, backspaces, and carriage
returns are each counted as taking up one column, just like other
characters.

‘`-s`’  
‘`--spaces`’  
<span id="index-_002ds-6"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dspaces"></span>

Break at word boundaries: the line is broken after the last blank before
the maximum line length. If the line contains no such blanks, the line
is broken at the maximum line length as usual.

‘`-w width`’  
‘`--width=width`’  
<span id="index-_002dw-5"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dwidth-3"></span>

Use a maximum line length of `width` columns instead of 80.

For compatibility `fold` supports an obsolete option syntax `-width`.
New scripts should use `-w width` instead.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

<span id="index-head"></span> <span
id="index-initial-part-of-files_002c-outputting"></span> <span
id="index-first-part-of-files_002c-outputting"></span>

`head` prints the first part (10 lines by default) of each `file`; it
reads from standard input if no files are given or when given a `file`
of `-`. Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
head [option]… [file]…
```

</div>

If more than one `file` is specified, `head` prints a one-line header
consisting of:

<div class="example">

``` example
==> file name <==
```

</div>

before the output for each `file`.

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`-c [-]num`’  
‘`--bytes=[-]num`’  
<span id="index-_002dc-3"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dbytes-1"></span>

Print the first `num` bytes, instead of initial lines. However, if `num`
is prefixed with a ‘`-`’, print all but the last `num` bytes of each
file. `num` may be, or may be an integer optionally followed by, one of
the following multiplicative suffixes:

<div class="example">

``` example
‘b’  =>            512 ("blocks")
‘KB’ =>           1000 (KiloBytes)
‘K’  =>           1024 (KibiBytes)
‘MB’ =>      1000*1000 (MegaBytes)
‘M’  =>      1024*1024 (MebiBytes)
‘GB’ => 1000*1000*1000 (GigaBytes)
‘G’  => 1024*1024*1024 (GibiBytes)
```

</div>

and so on for ‘`T`’, ‘`P`’, ‘`E`’, ‘`Z`’, and ‘`Y`’. Binary prefixes can
be used, too: ‘`KiB`’=‘`K`’, ‘`MiB`’=‘`M`’, and so on.

‘`-n [-]num`’  
‘`--lines=[-]num`’  
<span id="index-_002dn-3"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dlines"></span>

Output the first `num` lines. However, if `num` is prefixed with a
‘`-`’, print all but the last `num` lines of each file. Size multiplier
suffixes are the same as with the `-c` option.

‘`-q`’  
‘`--quiet`’  
‘`--silent`’  
<span id="index-_002dq"></span> <span id="index-_002d_002dquiet"></span>
<span id="index-_002d_002dsilent"></span>

Never print file name headers.

‘`-v`’  
‘`--verbose`’  
<span id="index-_002dv-4"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dverbose"></span>

Always print file name headers.

‘`-z`’  
‘`--zero-terminated`’  
<span id="index-_002dz"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dzero_002dterminated"></span> <span
id="index-process-zero_002dterminated-items"></span>

Delimit items with a zero byte rather than a newline (ASCII LF). I.e.,
treat input as items separated by ASCII NUL and terminate output items
with ASCII NUL. This option can be useful in conjunction with
‘`perl -0`’ or ‘`find -print0`’ and ‘`xargs -0`’ which do the same in
order to reliably handle arbitrary file names (even those containing
blanks or other special characters).

For compatibility `head` also supports an obsolete option syntax
`-[num][bkm][cqv]`, which is recognized only if it is specified first.
`num` is a decimal number optionally followed by a size letter (‘`b`’,
‘`k`’, ‘`m`’) as in `-c`, or ‘`l`’ to mean count by lines, or other
option letters (‘`cqv`’). Scripts intended for standard hosts should use
`-c num` or `-n num` instead. If your script must also run on hosts that
support only the obsolete syntax, it is usually simpler to avoid `head`,
e.g., by using ‘`sed 5q`’ instead of ‘`head -5`’.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

### 5.2 `tail`: Output the last part of files

<span id="index-tail"></span> <span
id="index-last-part-of-files_002c-outputting"></span>

`tail` prints the last part (10 lines by default) of each `file`; it
reads from standard input if no files are given or when given a `file`
of ‘`-`’. Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
tail [option]… [file]…
```

</div>

If more than one `file` is specified, `tail` prints a one-line header
before the output for each `file`, consisting of:

<div class="example">

``` example
==> file name <==
```

</div>

For further processing of tail output, it can be useful to convert the
file headers to line prefixes, which can be done like:

<div class="example">

``` example
tail … |
awk '
  /^==> .* <==$/ {prefix=substr($0,5,length-8)":"; next}
  {print prefix$0}
' | …
```

</div>

<span id="index-BSD-tail"></span>

GNU `tail` can output any amount of data (some other versions of `tail`
cannot). It also has no `-r` option (print in reverse), since reversing
a file is really a different job from printing the end of a file; BSD
`tail` (which is the one with `-r`) can only reverse files that are at
most as large as its buffer, which is typically 32 KiB. A more reliable
and versatile way to reverse files is the GNU `tac` command.

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`-c [+]num`’  
‘`--bytes=[+]num`’  
<span id="index-_002dc-4"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dbytes-2"></span>

Output the last `num` bytes, instead of final lines. However, if `num`
is prefixed with a ‘`+`’, start printing with byte `num` from the start
of each file, instead of from the end. `num` may be, or may be an
integer optionally followed by, one of the following multiplicative
suffixes:

<div class="example">

``` example
‘b’  =>            512 ("blocks")
‘KB’ =>           1000 (KiloBytes)
‘K’  =>           1024 (KibiBytes)
‘MB’ =>      1000*1000 (MegaBytes)
‘M’  =>      1024*1024 (MebiBytes)
‘GB’ => 1000*1000*1000 (GigaBytes)
‘G’  => 1024*1024*1024 (GibiBytes)
```

</div>

and so on for ‘`T`’, ‘`P`’, ‘`E`’, ‘`Z`’, and ‘`Y`’. Binary prefixes can
be used, too: ‘`KiB`’=‘`K`’, ‘`MiB`’=‘`M`’, and so on.

‘`-f`’  
‘`--follow[=how]`’  
<span id="index-_002df-3"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dfollow"></span> <span
id="index-growing-files"></span> <span
id="index-name-follow-option"></span> <span
id="index-descriptor-follow-option"></span>

Loop forever trying to read more characters at the end of the file,
presumably because the file is growing. If more than one file is given,
`tail` prints a header whenever it gets output from a different file, to
indicate which file that output is from.

There are two ways to specify how you’d like to track files with this
option, but that difference is noticeable only when a followed file is
removed or renamed. If you’d like to continue to track the end of a
growing file even after it has been unlinked, use `--follow=descriptor`.
This is the default behavior, but it is not useful if you’re tracking a
log file that may be rotated (removed or renamed, then reopened). In
that case, use `--follow=name` to track the named file, perhaps by
reopening it periodically to see if it has been removed and recreated by
some other program. Note that the inotify-based implementation handles
this case without the need for any periodic reopening.

No matter which method you use, if the tracked file is determined to
have shrunk, `tail` prints a message saying the file has been truncated
and resumes tracking from the start of the file, assuming it has been
truncated to 0, which is the usual truncation operation for log files.

When a file is removed, `tail`’s behavior depends on whether it is
following the name or the descriptor. When following by name, tail can
detect that a file has been removed and gives a message to that effect,
and if `--retry` has been specified it will continue checking
periodically to see if the file reappears. When following a descriptor,
tail does not detect that the file has been unlinked or renamed and
issues no message; even though the file may no longer be accessible via
its original name, it may still be growing.

The option values ‘`descriptor`’ and ‘`name`’ may be specified only with
the long form of the option, not with `-f`.

The `-f` option is ignored if no `file` operand is specified and
standard input is a FIFO or a pipe. Likewise, the `-f` option has no
effect for any operand specified as ‘`-`’, when standard input is a FIFO
or a pipe.

With kernel inotify support, output is triggered by file changes and is
generally very prompt. Otherwise, `tail` sleeps for one second between
checks— use `--sleep-interval=n` to change that default—which can make
the output appear slightly less responsive or bursty. When using tail
without inotify support, you can make it more responsive by using a
sub-second sleep interval, e.g., via an alias like this:

<div class="example">

``` example
alias tail='tail -s.1'
```

</div>

‘`-F`’  
<span id="index-_002dF-1"></span>

This option is the same as `--follow=name --retry`. That is, tail will
attempt to reopen a file when it is removed. Should this fail, tail will
keep trying until it becomes accessible again.

‘`--max-unchanged-stats=n`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dmax_002dunchanged_002dstats"></span>

When tailing a file by name, if there have been `n` (default n=5)
consecutive iterations for which the file has not changed, then
`open`/`fstat` the file to determine if that file name is still
associated with the same device/inode-number pair as before. When
following a log file that is rotated, this is approximately the number
of seconds between when tail prints the last pre-rotation lines and when
it prints the lines that have accumulated in the new log file. This
option is meaningful only when polling (i.e., without inotify) and when
following by name.

‘`-n [+]num`’  
‘`--lines=[+]`’  
<span id="index-_002dn-4"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dlines-1"></span>

Output the last `num` lines. However, if `num` is prefixed with a ‘`+`’,
start printing with line `num` from the start of each file, instead of
from the end. Size multiplier suffixes are the same as with the `-c`
option.

‘`--pid=pid`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dpid"></span>

When following by name or by descriptor, you may specify the process ID,
`pid`, of the sole writer of all `file` arguments. Then, shortly after
that process terminates, tail will also terminate. This will work
properly only if the writer and the tailing process are running on the
same machine. For example, to save the output of a build in a file and
to watch the file grow, if you invoke `make` and `tail` like this then
the tail process will stop when your build completes. Without this
option, you would have had to kill the `tail -f` process yourself.

<div class="example">

``` example
$ make >& makerr & tail --pid=$! -f makerr
```

</div>

If you specify a `pid` that is not in use or that does not correspond to
the process that is writing to the tailed files, then `tail` may
terminate long before any `file`s stop growing or it may not terminate
until long after the real writer has terminated. Note that `--pid`
cannot be supported on some systems; `tail` will print a warning if this
is the case.

‘`-q`’  
‘`--quiet`’  
‘`--silent`’  
<span id="index-_002dq-1"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dquiet-1"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dsilent-1"></span>

Never print file name headers.

‘`--retry`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dretry"></span>

Indefinitely try to open the specified file. This option is useful
mainly when following (and otherwise issues a warning).

When following by file descriptor (i.e., with `--follow=descriptor`),
this option only affects the initial open of the file, as after a
successful open, `tail` will start following the file descriptor.

When following by name (i.e., with `--follow=name`), `tail` infinitely
retries to re-open the given files until killed.

Without this option, when `tail` encounters a file that doesn’t exist or
is otherwise inaccessible, it reports that fact and never checks it
again.

‘`-s number`’  
‘`--sleep-interval=number`’  
<span id="index-_002ds-7"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dsleep_002dinterval"></span>

Change the number of seconds to wait between iterations (the default is
1.0). During one iteration, every specified file is checked to see if it
has changed size. When `tail` uses inotify, this polling-related option
is usually ignored. However, if you also specify `--pid=p`, `tail`
checks whether process `p` is alive at least every `number` seconds. The
`number` must be non-negative and can be a floating-point number in
either the current or the C locale. See [Floating
point](#Floating-point).

‘`-v`’  
‘`--verbose`’  
<span id="index-_002dv-5"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dverbose-1"></span>

Always print file name headers.

‘`-z`’  
‘`--zero-terminated`’  
<span id="index-_002dz-1"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dzero_002dterminated-1"></span> <span
id="index-process-zero_002dterminated-items-1"></span>

Delimit items with a zero byte rather than a newline (ASCII LF). I.e.,
treat input as items separated by ASCII NUL and terminate output items
with ASCII NUL. This option can be useful in conjunction with
‘`perl -0`’ or ‘`find -print0`’ and ‘`xargs -0`’ which do the same in
order to reliably handle arbitrary file names (even those containing
blanks or other special characters).

For compatibility `tail` also supports an obsolete usage
‘`tail -[num][bcl][f] [file]`’, which is recognized only if it does not
conflict with the usage described above. This obsolete form uses exactly
one option and at most one file. In the option, `num` is an optional
decimal number optionally followed by a size letter (‘`b`’, ‘`c`’,
‘`l`’) to mean count by 512-byte blocks, bytes, or lines, optionally
followed by ‘`f`’ which has the same meaning as `-f`.

<span id="index-_005fPOSIX2_005fVERSION-1"></span>

On systems not conforming to POSIX 1003.1-2001, the leading ‘`-`’ can be
replaced by ‘`+`’ in the traditional option syntax with the same meaning
as in counts, and on obsolete systems predating POSIX 1003.1-2001
traditional usage overrides normal usage when the two conflict. This
behavior can be controlled with the `_POSIX2_VERSION` environment
variable (see [Standards conformance](#Standards-conformance)).

Scripts intended for use on standard hosts should avoid traditional
syntax and should use `-c num[b]`, `-n num`, and/or `-f` instead. If
your script must also run on hosts that support only the traditional
syntax, you can often rewrite it to avoid problematic usages, e.g., by
using ‘`sed -n '$p'`’ rather than ‘`tail -1`’. If that’s not possible,
the script can use a test like
‘`if tail -c +1 </dev/null >/dev/null 2>&1; then …`’ to decide which
syntax to use.

Even if your script assumes the standard behavior, you should still
beware usages whose behaviors differ depending on the POSIX version. For
example, avoid ‘`tail - main.c`’, since it might be interpreted as
either ‘`tail main.c`’ or as ‘`tail -- - main.c`’; avoid ‘`tail -c 4`’,
since it might mean either ‘`tail -c4`’ or ‘`tail -c 10 4`’; and avoid
‘`tail +4`’, since it might mean either ‘`tail ./+4`’ or ‘`tail -n +4`’.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

<span id="split_003a-Split-a-file-into-pieces_002e"></span>

### 5.3 `split`: Split a file into pieces.

<span id="index-split"></span> <span
id="index-splitting-a-file-into-pieces"></span> <span
id="index-pieces_002c-splitting-a-file-into"></span>

`split` creates output files containing consecutive or interleaved
sections of `input` (standard input if none is given or `input` is
‘`-`’). Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
split [option] [input [prefix]]
```

</div>

By default, `split` puts 1000 lines of `input` (or whatever is left over
for the last section), into each output file.

<span id="index-output-file-name-prefix"></span>

The output files’ names consist of `prefix` (‘`x`’ by default) followed
by a group of characters (‘`aa`’, ‘`ab`’, … by default), such that
concatenating the output files in traditional sorted order by file name
produces the original input file (except `-nr/n`). By default split will
initially create files with two generated suffix characters, and will
increase this width by two when the next most significant position
reaches the last character. (‘`yz`’, ‘`zaaa`’, ‘`zaab`’, …). In this way
an arbitrary number of output files are supported, which sort as
described above, even in the presence of an `--additional-suffix`
option. If the `-a` option is specified and the output file names are
exhausted, `split` reports an error without deleting the output files
that it did create.

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`-l lines`’  
‘`--lines=lines`’  
<span id="index-_002dl-3"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dlines-2"></span>

Put `lines` lines of `input` into each output file. If `--separator` is
specified, then `lines` determines the number of records.

For compatibility `split` also supports an obsolete option syntax
`-lines`. New scripts should use `-l lines` instead.

‘`-b size`’  
‘`--bytes=size`’  
<span id="index-_002db-6"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dbytes-3"></span>

Put `size` bytes of `input` into each output file. `size` may be, or may
be an integer optionally followed by, one of the following
multiplicative suffixes:

<div class="example">

``` example
‘b’  =>            512 ("blocks")
‘KB’ =>           1000 (KiloBytes)
‘K’  =>           1024 (KibiBytes)
‘MB’ =>      1000*1000 (MegaBytes)
‘M’  =>      1024*1024 (MebiBytes)
‘GB’ => 1000*1000*1000 (GigaBytes)
‘G’  => 1024*1024*1024 (GibiBytes)
```

</div>

and so on for ‘`T`’, ‘`P`’, ‘`E`’, ‘`Z`’, and ‘`Y`’. Binary prefixes can
be used, too: ‘`KiB`’=‘`K`’, ‘`MiB`’=‘`M`’, and so on.

‘`-C size`’  
‘`--line-bytes=size`’  
<span id="index-_002dC"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dline_002dbytes"></span>

Put into each output file as many complete lines of `input` as possible
without exceeding `size` bytes. Individual lines or records longer than
`size` bytes are broken into multiple files. `size` has the same format
as for the `--bytes` option. If `--separator` is specified, then `lines`
determines the number of records.

‘`--filter=command`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dfilter"></span>

With this option, rather than simply writing to each output file, write
through a pipe to the specified shell `command` for each output file.
`command` should use the $FILE environment variable, which is set to a
different output file name for each invocation of the command. For
example, imagine that you have a 1TiB compressed file that, if
uncompressed, would be too large to reside on secondary storage, yet you
must split it into individually-compressed pieces of a more manageable
size. To do that, you might run this command:

<div class="example">

``` example
xz -dc BIG.xz | split -b200G --filter='xz > $FILE.xz' - big-
```

</div>

Assuming a 10:1 compression ratio, that would create about fifty 20GiB
files with names `big-aa.xz`, `big-ab.xz`, `big-ac.xz`, etc.

‘`-n chunks`’  
‘`--number=chunks`’  
<span id="index-_002dn-5"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dnumber-1"></span>

Split `input` to `chunks` output files where `chunks` may be:

<div class="example">

``` example
n      generate n files based on current size of input
k/n    output only kth of n to standard output
l/n    generate n files without splitting lines or records
l/k/n  likewise but output only kth of n to stdout
r/n    like ‘l’ but use round robin distribution
r/k/n  likewise but output only kth of n to stdout
```

</div>

Any excess bytes remaining after dividing the `input` into `n` chunks,
are assigned to the last chunk. Any excess bytes appearing after the
initial calculation are discarded (except when using ‘`r`’ mode).

All `n` files are created even if there are fewer than `n` lines, or the
`input` is truncated.

For ‘`l`’ mode, chunks are approximately `input` size / `n`. The `input`
is partitioned into `n` equal sized portions, with the last assigned any
excess. If a line *starts* within a partition it is written completely
to the corresponding file. Since lines or records are not split even if
they overlap a partition, the files written can be larger or smaller
than the partition size, and even empty if a line/record is so long as
to completely overlap the partition.

For ‘`r`’ mode, the size of `input` is irrelevant, and so can be a pipe
for example.

‘`-a length`’  
‘`--suffix-length=length`’  
<span id="index-_002da-2"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dsuffix_002dlength"></span>

Use suffixes of length `length`. If a `length` of 0 is specified, this
is the same as if (any previous) `-a` was not specified, and thus
enables the default behavior, which starts the suffix length at 2, and
unless `-n` or `--numeric-suffixes=from` is specified, will auto
increase the length by 2 as required.

‘`-d`’  
‘`--numeric-suffixes[=from]`’  
<span id="index-_002dd-4"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dnumeric_002dsuffixes"></span>

Use digits in suffixes rather than lower-case letters. The numerical
suffix counts from `from` if specified, 0 otherwise.

`from` is supported with the long form option, and is used to either set
the initial suffix for a single run, or to set the suffix offset for
independently split inputs, and consequently the auto suffix length
expansion described above is disabled. Therefore you may also want to
use option `-a` to allow suffixes beyond ‘`99`’. Note if option
`--number` is specified and the number of files is less than `from`, a
single run is assumed and the minimum suffix length required is
automatically determined.

‘`-x`’  
‘`--hex-suffixes[=from]`’  
<span id="index-_002dx-1"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dhex_002dsuffixes"></span>

Like `--numeric-suffixes`, but use hexadecimal numbers (in lower case).

‘`--additional-suffix=suffix`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dadditional_002dsuffix"></span>

Append an additional `suffix` to output file names. `suffix` must not
contain slash.

‘`-e`’  
‘`--elide-empty-files`’  
<span id="index-_002de-2"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002delide_002dempty_002dfiles"></span>

Suppress the generation of zero-length output files. This can happen
with the `--number` option if a file is (truncated to be) shorter than
the number requested, or if a line is so long as to completely span a
chunk. The output file sequence numbers, always run consecutively even
when this option is specified.

‘`-t separator`’  
‘`--separator=separator`’  
<span id="index-_002dt-4"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dseparator-2"></span> <span
id="index-line-separator-character"></span> <span
id="index-record-separator-character"></span>

Use character `separator` as the record separator instead of the default
newline character (ASCII LF). To specify ASCII NUL as the separator, use
the two-character string ‘`\0`’, e.g., ‘`split -t '\0'`’.

‘`-u`’  
‘`--unbuffered`’  
<span id="index-_002du-2"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dunbuffered"></span>

Immediately copy input to output in `--number r/…` mode, which is a much
slower mode of operation.

‘`--verbose`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dverbose-2"></span>

Write a diagnostic just before each output file is opened.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

Here are a few examples to illustrate how the `--number` (`-n`) option
works:

Notice how, by default, one line may be split onto two or more:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ seq -w 6 10 > k; split -n3 k; head xa?
==> xaa <==
06
07
==> xab <==

08
0
==> xac <==
9
10
```

</div>

Use the "l/" modifier to suppress that:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ seq -w 6 10 > k; split -nl/3 k; head xa?
==> xaa <==
06
07

==> xab <==
08
09

==> xac <==
10
```

</div>

Use the "r/" modifier to distribute lines in a round-robin fashion:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ seq -w 6 10 > k; split -nr/3 k; head xa?
==> xaa <==
06
09

==> xab <==
07
10

==> xac <==
08
```

</div>

You can also extract just the Kth chunk. This extracts and prints just
the 7th "chunk" of 33:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ seq 100 > k; split -nl/7/33 k
20
21
22
```

</div>

### 5.4 `csplit`: Split a file into context-determined pieces

<span id="index-csplit"></span> <span
id="index-context-splitting"></span> <span
id="index-splitting-a-file-into-pieces-by-context"></span>

`csplit` creates zero or more output files containing sections of
`input` (standard input if `input` is ‘`-`’). Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
csplit [option]… input pattern…
```

</div>

The contents of the output files are determined by the `pattern`
arguments, as detailed below. An error occurs if a `pattern` argument
refers to a nonexistent line of the input file (e.g., if no remaining
line matches a given regular expression). After every `pattern` has been
matched, any remaining input is copied into one last output file.

By default, `csplit` prints the number of bytes written to each output
file after it has been created.

The types of pattern arguments are:

‘`n`’  
Create an output file containing the input up to but not including line
`n` (a positive integer). If followed by a repeat count, also create an
output file containing the next `n` lines of the input file once for
each repeat.

‘`/regexp/[offset]`’  
Create an output file containing the current line up to (but not
including) the next line of the input file that contains a match for
`regexp`. The optional `offset` is an integer, that can be preceded by
‘`+`’ or ‘`-`’. If it is given, the input up to (but not including) the
matching line plus or minus `offset` is put into the output file, and
the line after that begins the next section of input. Note lines within
a negative offset of a regexp pattern are not matched in subsequent
regexp patterns.

‘`%regexp%[offset]`’  
Like the previous type, except that it does not create an output file,
so that section of the input file is effectively ignored.

‘`{repeat-count}`’  
Repeat the previous pattern `repeat-count` additional times. The
`repeat-count` can either be a positive integer or an asterisk, meaning
repeat as many times as necessary until the input is exhausted.

The output files’ names consist of a prefix (‘`xx`’ by default) followed
by a suffix. By default, the suffix is an ascending sequence of
two-digit decimal numbers from ‘`00`’ to ‘`99`’. In any case,
concatenating the output files in sorted order by file name produces the
original input file, excluding portions skipped with a %`regexp`%
pattern or the `--suppress-matched` option.

By default, if `csplit` encounters an error or receives a hangup,
interrupt, quit, or terminate signal, it removes any output files that
it has created so far before it exits.

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`-f prefix`’  
‘`--prefix=prefix`’  
<span id="index-_002df-4"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dprefix"></span> <span
id="index-output-file-name-prefix-1"></span>

Use `prefix` as the output file name prefix.

‘`-b format`’  
‘`--suffix-format=format`’  
<span id="index-_002db-7"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dsuffix_002dformat"></span> <span
id="index-output-file-name-suffix"></span>

Use `format` as the output file name suffix. When this option is
specified, the suffix string must include exactly one `printf(3)`-style
conversion specification, possibly including format specification flags,
a field width, a precision specification, or all of these kinds of
modifiers. The format letter must convert a binary unsigned integer
argument to readable form. The format letters ‘`d`’ and ‘`i`’ are
aliases for ‘`u`’, and the ‘`u`’, ‘`o`’, ‘`x`’, and ‘`X`’ conversions
are allowed. The entire `format` is given (with the current output file
number) to `sprintf(3)` to form the file name suffixes for each of the
individual output files in turn. If this option is used, the `--digits`
option is ignored.

‘`-n digits`’  
‘`--digits=digits`’  
<span id="index-_002dn-6"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002ddigits"></span>

Use output file names containing numbers that are `digits` digits long
instead of the default 2.

‘`-k`’  
‘`--keep-files`’  
<span id="index-_002dk-1"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dkeep_002dfiles"></span>

Do not remove output files when errors are encountered.

‘`--suppress-matched`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dsuppress_002dmatched"></span>

Do not output lines matching the specified `pattern`. I.e., suppress the
boundary line from the start of the second and subsequent splits.

‘`-z`’  
‘`--elide-empty-files`’  
<span id="index-_002dz-2"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002delide_002dempty_002dfiles-1"></span>

Suppress the generation of zero-length output files. (In cases where the
section delimiters of the input file are supposed to mark the first
lines of each of the sections, the first output file will generally be a
zero-length file unless you use this option.) The output file sequence
numbers always run consecutively starting from 0, even when this option
is specified.

‘`-s`’  
‘`-q`’  
‘`--silent`’  
‘`--quiet`’  
<span id="index-_002ds-8"></span> <span id="index-_002dq-2"></span>
<span id="index-_002d_002dsilent-2"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dquiet-2"></span>

Do not print counts of output file sizes.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

Here is an example of its usage. First, create an empty directory for
the exercise, and cd into it:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ mkdir d && cd d
```

</div>

Now, split the sequence of 1..14 on lines that end with 0 or 5:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ seq 14 | csplit - '/[05]$/' '{*}'
8
10
15
```

</div>

Each number printed above is the size of an output file that csplit has
just created. List the names of those output files:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ ls
xx00  xx01  xx02
```

</div>

Use `head` to show their contents:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ head xx*
==> xx00 <==
1
2
3
4

==> xx01 <==
5
6
7
8
9

==> xx02 <==
10
11
12
13
14
```

</div>

Example of splitting input by empty lines:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ csplit --suppress-matched input.txt '/^$/' '{*}'
```

</div>

<span id="wc_003a-Print-newline_002c-word_002c-and-byte-counts"></span>

### 6.1 `wc`: Print newline, word, and byte counts

<span id="index-wc"></span> <span id="index-byte-count"></span> <span
id="index-character-count"></span> <span id="index-word-count"></span>
<span id="index-line-count"></span>

`wc` counts the number of bytes, characters, words, and newlines in each
given `file`, or standard input if none are given or for a `file` of
‘`-`’. A word is a nonzero length sequence of printable characters
delimited by white space. Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
wc [option]… [file]…
```

</div>

<span id="index-total-counts"></span>

`wc` prints one line of counts for each file, and if the file was given
as an argument, it prints the file name following the counts. If more
than one `file` is given, `wc` prints a final line containing the
cumulative counts, with the file name `total`. The counts are printed in
this order: newlines, words, characters, bytes, maximum line length.
Each count is printed right-justified in a field with at least one space
between fields so that the numbers and file names normally line up
nicely in columns. The width of the count fields varies depending on the
inputs, so you should not depend on a particular field width. However,
as a GNU extension, if only one count is printed, it is guaranteed to be
printed without leading spaces.

By default, `wc` prints three counts: the newline, words, and byte
counts. Options can specify that only certain counts be printed. Options
do not undo others previously given, so

<div class="example">

``` example
wc --bytes --words
```

</div>

prints both the byte counts and the word counts.

With the `--max-line-length` option, `wc` prints the length of the
longest line per file, and if there is more than one file it prints the
maximum (not the sum) of those lengths. The line lengths here are
measured in screen columns, according to the current locale and assuming
tab positions in every 8th column.

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`-c`’  
‘`--bytes`’  
<span id="index-_002dc-5"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dbytes-4"></span>

Print only the byte counts.

‘`-m`’  
‘`--chars`’  
<span id="index-_002dm-1"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dchars"></span>

Print only the character counts, as per the current locale. Invalid
characters are not counted.

‘`-w`’  
‘`--words`’  
<span id="index-_002dw-6"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dwords"></span>

Print only the word counts. A word is a nonzero length sequence of
printable characters separated by white space.

‘`-l`’  
‘`--lines`’  
<span id="index-_002dl-4"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dlines-3"></span>

Print only the newline character counts. Note a file without a trailing
newline character, will not have that last portion included in the line
count.

‘`-L`’  
‘`--max-line-length`’  
<span id="index-_002dL-1"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dmax_002dline_002dlength"></span>

Print only the maximum display widths. Tabs are set at every 8th column.
Display widths of wide characters are considered. Non-printable
characters are given 0 width.

‘`--files0-from=file`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dfiles0_002dfrom_003dfile"></span>

Disallow processing files named on the command line, and instead process
those named in file `file`; each name being terminated by a zero byte
(ASCII NUL). This is useful when the list of file names is so long that
it may exceed a command line length limitation. In such cases, running
`wc` via `xargs` is undesirable because it splits the list into pieces
and makes `wc` print a total for each sublist rather than for the entire
list. One way to produce a list of ASCII NUL terminated file names is
with GNU `find`, using its `-print0` predicate. If `file` is ‘`-`’ then
the ASCII NUL terminated file names are read from standard input.

For example, to find the length of the longest line in any `.c` or `.h`
file in the current hierarchy, do this:

<div class="example">

``` example
find . -name '*.[ch]' -print0 |
  wc -L --files0-from=- | tail -n1
```

</div>

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

<span id="index-sum"></span> <span
id="index-16_002dbit-checksum"></span> <span
id="index-checksum_002c-16_002dbit"></span>

`sum` computes a 16-bit checksum for each given `file`, or standard
input if none are given or for a `file` of ‘`-`’. Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
sum [option]… [file]…
```

</div>

`sum` prints the checksum for each `file` followed by the number of
blocks in the file (rounded up). If at least one `file` is given, file
names are also printed.

By default, GNU `sum` computes checksums using an algorithm compatible
with BSD `sum` and prints file sizes in units of 1024-byte blocks.

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`-r`’  
<span id="index-_002dr-2"></span> <span id="index-BSD-sum"></span>

Use the default (BSD compatible) algorithm. This option is included for
compatibility with the System V `sum`. Unless `-s` was also given, it
has no effect.

‘`-s`’  
‘`--sysv`’  
<span id="index-_002ds-9"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dsysv"></span> <span id="index-System-V-sum"></span>

Compute checksums using an algorithm compatible with System V `sum`’s
default, and print file sizes in units of 512-byte blocks.

`sum` is provided for compatibility; the `cksum` program (see next
section) is preferable in new applications.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

### 6.3 `cksum`: Print and verify file checksums

<span id="index-cksum"></span> <span
id="index-cyclic-redundancy-check"></span> <span
id="index-CRC-checksum"></span> <span id="index-digest"></span>

`cksum` by default computes a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) checksum for
each given `file`, or standard input if none are given or for a `file`
of ‘`-`’.

cksum also supports the `-a,--algorithm` option to select the digest
algorithm to use. `cksum` is the preferred interface to these digests,
subsuming the other standalone checksumming utilities, which can be
emulated using `cksum -a md5 --untagged "$@"` etc. Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
cksum [option]… [file]…
```

</div>

`cksum` is typically used to ensure that files have not been corrupted,
by comparing the `cksum` output for the received files with the `cksum`
output for the original files (typically given in the distribution).

`cksum` by default prints the POSIX standard CRC checksum for each file
along with the number of bytes in the file, and the file name unless no
arguments were given.

The same usage and options as the `b2sum` command are supported. See
[b2sum invocation](#b2sum-invocation). In addition `cksum` supports the
following options.

‘`-a`’  
‘`--algorithm`’  
<span id="index-_002da-3"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dalgorithm"></span> <span
id="index-digest-algorithm"></span>

Compute checksums using the specified digest algorithm.

Supported legacy checksums (which are not supported by `--check`):

<div class="example">

``` example
‘sysv’      equivalent to sum -s
‘bsd’       equivalent to sum -r
‘crc’       equivalent to cksum (the default)
```

</div>

Supported more modern digest algorithms are:

<div class="example">

``` example
‘md5’       equivalent to md5sum
‘sha1’      equivalent to sha1sum
‘sha224’    equivalent to sha224sum
‘sha256’    equivalent to sha256sum
‘sha384’    equivalent to sha384sum
‘sha512’    equivalent to sha512sum
‘blake2b’   equivalent to b2sum
‘sm3’       only available through cksum
```

</div>

‘`--debug`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002ddebug"></span>

Output extra information to stderr, like the checksum implementation
being used.

‘`--untagged`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002duntagged"></span>

Output using the original Coreutils format used by the other standalone
checksum utilities like `md5sum` for example. This format has the
checksum at the start of the line, and may be more amenable to further
processing by other utilities, especially in combination with the
`--zero` option. Note this does not identify the digest algorithm used
for the checksum. See [md5sum invocation](#md5sum-invocation) for
details of this format.

id="index-fingerprint_002c-128_002dbit"></span> <span
id="index-message_002ddigest_002c-128_002dbit"></span>

`md5sum` computes a 128-bit checksum (or *fingerprint* or
*message-digest*) for each specified `file`.

Note: The MD5 digest is more reliable than a simple CRC (provided by the
`cksum` command) for detecting accidental file corruption, as the
chances of accidentally having two files with identical MD5 are
vanishingly small. However, it should not be considered secure against
malicious tampering: although finding a file with a given MD5
fingerprint is considered infeasible at the moment, it is known how to
modify certain files, including digital certificates, so that they
appear valid when signed with an MD5 digest. For more secure hashes,
consider using SHA-2, or the newer `b2sum` command. See [sha2
utilities](#sha2-utilities). See [b2sum invocation](#b2sum-invocation).

If a `file` is specified as ‘`-`’ or if no files are given `md5sum`
computes the checksum for the standard input. `md5sum` can also
determine whether a file and checksum are consistent. Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
md5sum [option]… [file]…
```

</div>

For each `file`, ‘`md5sum`’ outputs by default, the MD5 checksum, a
space, a flag indicating binary or text input mode, and the file name.
Binary mode is indicated with ‘`*`’, text mode with ‘` `’ (space).
Binary mode is the default on systems where it’s significant, otherwise
text mode is the default. The `cksum` command always uses binary mode
and a ‘` `’ (space) flag.

Without `--zero`, if `file` contains a backslash, newline, or carriage
return, the line is started with a backslash, and each problematic
character in the file name is escaped with a backslash, making the
output unambiguous even in the presence of arbitrary file names.

If `file` is omitted or specified as ‘`-`’, standard input is read.

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`-b`’  
‘`--binary`’  
<span id="index-_002db-8"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dbinary"></span> <span
id="index-binary-input-files"></span>

Note this option is not supported by the `cksum` command, as it operates
in binary mode exclusively. Treat each input file as binary, by reading
it in binary mode and outputting a ‘`*`’ flag. This is the inverse of
`--text`. On systems like GNU that do not distinguish between binary and
text files, this option merely flags each input mode as binary: the MD5
checksum is unaffected. This option is the default on systems like
MS-DOS that distinguish between binary and text files, except for
reading standard input when standard input is a terminal.

‘`-c`’  
‘`--check`’  
Read file names and checksum information (not data) from each `file` (or
from standard input if no `file` was specified) and report whether the
checksums match the contents of the named files. The input to this mode
of `md5sum` is usually the output of a prior, checksum-generating run of
‘`md5sum`’.

Three input formats are supported. Either the default output format
described above, the `--tag` output format, or the BSD reversed mode
format which is similar to the default mode, but doesn’t use a character
to distinguish binary and text modes.

For the `cksum` command, the `--check` option supports auto-detecting
the digest algorithm to use, when presented with checksum information in
the `--tag` output format.

Output with `--zero` enabled is not supported by `--check`.

  

For each such line, `md5sum` reads the named file and computes its MD5
checksum. Then, if the computed message digest does not match the one on
the line with the file name, the file is noted as having failed the
test. Otherwise, the file passes the test. By default, for each valid
line, one line is written to standard output indicating whether the
named file passed the test. After all checks have been performed, if
there were any failures, a warning is issued to standard error. Use the
`--status` option to inhibit that output. If any listed file cannot be
opened or read, if any valid line has an MD5 checksum inconsistent with
the associated file, or if no valid line is found, `md5sum` exits with
nonzero status. Otherwise, it exits successfully. Note the `cksum`
command doesn’t support `--check` with the older ‘`sysv`’, ‘`bsd`’, or
‘`crc`’ algorithms.

‘`--ignore-missing`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dignore_002dmissing"></span> <span
id="index-verifying-MD5-checksums"></span>

This option is useful only when verifying checksums. When verifying
checksums, don’t fail or report any status for missing files. This is
useful when verifying a subset of downloaded files given a larger list
of checksums.

‘`--quiet`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dquiet-3"></span> <span
id="index-verifying-MD5-checksums-1"></span>

This option is useful only when verifying checksums. When verifying
checksums, don’t generate an ’OK’ message per successfully checked file.
Files that fail the verification are reported in the default
one-line-per-file format. If there is any checksum mismatch, print a
warning summarizing the failures to standard error.

‘`--status`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dstatus"></span> <span
id="index-verifying-MD5-checksums-2"></span>

This option is useful only when verifying checksums. When verifying
checksums, don’t generate the default one-line-per-file diagnostic and
don’t output the warning summarizing any failures. Failures to open or
read a file still evoke individual diagnostics to standard error. If all
listed files are readable and are consistent with the associated MD5
checksums, exit successfully. Otherwise exit with a status code
indicating there was a failure.

‘`--tag`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dtag"></span> <span
id="index-BSD-output"></span>

Output BSD style checksums, which indicate the checksum algorithm used.
As a GNU extension, if `--zero` is not used, file names with problematic
characters are escaped as described above, with the same escaping
indicator of ‘`\`’ at the start of the line, being used. The `--tag`
option implies binary mode, and is disallowed with `--text` mode as
supporting that would unnecessarily complicate the output format, while
providing little benefit. The `cksum` command, uses `--tag` as its
default output format.

‘`-t`’  
‘`--text`’  
<span id="index-_002dt-5"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dtext"></span> <span
id="index-text-input-files"></span>

Note this option is not supported by the `cksum` command. Treat each
input file as text, by reading it in text mode and outputting a ‘` `’
flag. This is the inverse of `--binary`. This option is the default on
systems like GNU that do not distinguish between binary and text files.
On other systems, it is the default for reading standard input when
standard input is a terminal. This mode is never defaulted to if `--tag`
is used.

‘`-w`’  
‘`--warn`’  
<span id="index-_002dw-7"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dwarn"></span> <span
id="index-verifying-MD5-checksums-3"></span>

When verifying checksums, warn about improperly formatted MD5 checksum
lines. This option is useful only if all but a few lines in the checked
input are valid.

‘`--strict`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dstrict"></span> <span
id="index-verifying-MD5-checksums-4"></span>

When verifying checksums, if one or more input line is invalid, exit
nonzero after all warnings have been issued.

‘`-z`’  
‘`--zero`’  
<span id="index-_002dz-3"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dzero"></span> <span
id="index-output-NUL_002dbyte_002dterminated-lines"></span>

Output a zero byte (ASCII NUL) at the end of each line, rather than a
newline. This option enables other programs to parse the output even
when that output would contain data with embedded newlines. Also file
name escaping is not used.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

id="index-message_002ddigest_002c-160_002dbit"></span>

`sha1sum` computes a 160-bit checksum for each specified `file`. The
usage and options of this command are precisely the same as for
`md5sum`. See [md5sum invocation](#md5sum-invocation).

Note: The SHA-1 digest is more reliable than a simple CRC (provided by
the `cksum` command) for detecting accidental file corruption, as the
chances of accidentally having two files with identical SHA-1 are
vanishingly small. However, it should not be considered secure against
malicious tampering: although finding a file with a given SHA-1
fingerprint is considered infeasible at the moment, it is known how to
modify certain files, including digital certificates, so that they
appear valid when signed with an SHA-1 digest. For more secure hashes,
consider using SHA-2, or the newer `b2sum` command. See [sha2
utilities](#sha2-utilities). See [b2sum invocation](#b2sum-invocation).

<span id="sort_003a-Sort-text-files"></span>

### 7.1 `sort`: Sort text files

<span id="index-sort"></span> <span id="index-sorting-files"></span>

`sort` sorts, merges, or compares all the lines from the given files, or
standard input if none are given or for a `file` of ‘`-`’. By default,
`sort` writes the results to standard output. Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
sort [option]… [file]…
```

</div>

<span id="index-sort-stability"></span> <span
id="index-sort_0027s-last_002dresort-comparison"></span>

Many options affect how `sort` compares lines; if the results are
unexpected, try the `--debug` option to see what happened. A pair of
lines is compared as follows: `sort` compares each pair of fields (see
`--key`), in the order specified on the command line, according to the
associated ordering options, until a difference is found or no fields
are left. If no key fields are specified, `sort` uses a default key of
the entire line. Finally, as a last resort when all keys compare equal,
`sort` compares entire lines as if no ordering options other than
`--reverse` (`-r`) were specified. The `--stable` (`-s`) option disables
this *last-resort comparison* so that lines in which all fields compare
equal are left in their original relative order. The `--unique` (`-u`)
option also disables the last-resort comparison. <span
id="index-LC_005fALL"></span> <span id="index-LC_005fCOLLATE"></span>

Unless otherwise specified, all comparisons use the character collating
sequence specified by the `LC_COLLATE`
locale.<a href="#FOOT2" id="DOCF2"><sup>2</sup></a> A line’s trailing
newline is not part of the line for comparison purposes. If the final
byte of an input file is not a newline, GNU `sort` silently supplies
one. GNU `sort` (as specified for all GNU utilities) has no limit on
input line length or restrictions on bytes allowed within lines.

`sort` has three modes of operation: sort (the default), merge, and
check for sortedness. The following options change the operation mode:

‘`-c`’  
‘`--check`’  
‘`--check=diagnose-first`’  
<span id="index-_002dc-6"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dcheck"></span> <span
id="index-checking-for-sortedness"></span>

Check whether the given file is already sorted: if it is not all sorted,
print a diagnostic containing the first out-of-order line and exit with
a status of 1. Otherwise, exit successfully. At most one input file can
be given.

‘`-C`’  
‘`--check=quiet`’  
‘`--check=silent`’  
<span id="index-_002dc-7"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dcheck-1"></span> <span
id="index-checking-for-sortedness-1"></span>

Exit successfully if the given file is already sorted, and exit with
status 1 otherwise. At most one input file can be given. This is like
`-c`, except it does not print a diagnostic.

‘`-m`’  
‘`--merge`’  
<span id="index-_002dm-2"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dmerge-1"></span> <span
id="index-merging-sorted-files"></span>

Merge the given files by sorting them as a group. Each input file must
always be individually sorted. It always works to sort instead of merge;
merging is provided because it is faster, in the case where it works.

<span id="index-exit-status-of-sort"></span>

Exit status:

<div class="display">

``` display
0 if no error occurred
1 if invoked with -c or -C and the input is not sorted
2 if an error occurred
```

</div>

<span id="index-TMPDIR"></span>

If the environment variable `TMPDIR` is set, `sort` uses its value as
the directory for temporary files instead of `/tmp`. The
`--temporary-directory` (`-T`) option in turn overrides the environment
variable.

The following options affect the ordering of output lines. They may be
specified globally or as part of a specific key field. If no key fields
are specified, global options apply to comparison of entire lines;
otherwise the global options are inherited by key fields that do not
specify any special options of their own. In pre-POSIX versions of
`sort`, global options affect only later key fields, so portable shell
scripts should specify global options first.

‘`-b`’  
‘`--ignore-leading-blanks`’  
<span id="index-_002db-9"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dignore_002dleading_002dblanks"></span> <span
id="index-blanks_002c-ignoring-leading"></span> <span
id="index-LC_005fCTYPE"></span>

Ignore leading blanks when finding sort keys in each line. By default a
blank is a space or a tab, but the `LC_CTYPE` locale can change this.
Note blanks may be ignored by your locale’s collating rules, but without
this option they will be significant for character positions specified
in keys with the `-k` option.

‘`-d`’  
‘`--dictionary-order`’  
<span id="index-_002dd-5"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002ddictionary_002dorder"></span> <span
id="index-dictionary-order"></span> <span
id="index-phone-directory-order"></span> <span
id="index-telephone-directory-order"></span> <span
id="index-LC_005fCTYPE-1"></span>

Sort in *phone directory* order: ignore all characters except letters,
digits and blanks when sorting. By default letters and digits are those
of ASCII and a blank is a space or a tab, but the `LC_CTYPE` locale can
change this.

‘`-f`’  
‘`--ignore-case`’  
<span id="index-_002df-5"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dignore_002dcase"></span> <span
id="index-ignoring-case"></span> <span id="index-case-folding"></span>
<span id="index-LC_005fCTYPE-2"></span>

Fold lowercase characters into the equivalent uppercase characters when
comparing so that, for example, ‘`b`’ and ‘`B`’ sort as equal. The
`LC_CTYPE` locale determines character types. When used with `--unique`
those lower case equivalent lines are thrown away. (There is currently
no way to throw away the upper case equivalent instead. (Any `--reverse`
given would only affect the final result, after the throwing away.))

‘`-g`’  
‘`--general-numeric-sort`’  
‘`--sort=general-numeric`’  
<span id="index-_002dg-1"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dgeneral_002dnumeric_002dsort"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dsort"></span> <span
id="index-general-numeric-sort"></span> <span
id="index-LC_005fNUMERIC-2"></span>

Sort numerically, converting a prefix of each line to a long
double-precision floating point number. See [Floating
point](#Floating-point). Do not report overflow, underflow, or
conversion errors. Use the following collating sequence:

-   Lines that do not start with numbers (all considered to be equal).
-   NaNs (“Not a Number” values, in IEEE floating point arithmetic) in a
    consistent but machine-dependent order.
-   Minus infinity.
-   Finite numbers in ascending numeric order (with *-0* and *+0*
    equal).
-   Plus infinity.

Use this option only if there is no alternative; it is much slower than
`--numeric-sort` (`-n`) and it can lose information when converting to
floating point.

You can use this option to sort hexadecimal numbers prefixed with ‘`0x`’
or ‘`0X`’, where those numbers are not fixed width, or of varying case.
However for hex numbers of consistent case, and left padded with ‘`0`’
to a consistent width, a standard lexicographic sort will be faster.

‘`-h`’  
‘`--human-numeric-sort`’  
‘`--sort=human-numeric`’  
<span id="index-_002dh-3"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dhuman_002dnumeric_002dsort"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dsort-1"></span> <span
id="index-human-numeric-sort"></span> <span
id="index-LC_005fNUMERIC-3"></span>

Sort numerically, first by numeric sign (negative, zero, or positive);
then by SI suffix (either empty, or ‘`k`’ or ‘`K`’, or one of
‘`MGTPEZY`’, in that order; see [Block size](#Block-size)); and finally
by numeric value. For example, ‘`1023M`’ sorts before ‘`1G`’ because
‘`M`’ (mega) precedes ‘`G`’ (giga) as an SI suffix. This option sorts
values that are consistently scaled to the nearest suffix, regardless of
whether suffixes denote powers of 1000 or 1024, and it therefore sorts
the output of any single invocation of the `df`, `du`, or `ls` commands
that are invoked with their `--human-readable` or `--si` options. The
syntax for numbers is the same as for the `--numeric-sort` option; the
SI suffix must immediately follow the number. Note also the `numfmt`
command, which can be used to reformat numbers to human format *after*
the sort, thus often allowing sort to operate on more accurate numbers.

‘`-i`’  
‘`--ignore-nonprinting`’  
<span id="index-_002di-4"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dignore_002dnonprinting"></span> <span
id="index-nonprinting-characters_002c-ignoring"></span> <span
id="index-unprintable-characters_002c-ignoring"></span> <span
id="index-LC_005fCTYPE-3"></span>

Ignore nonprinting characters. The `LC_CTYPE` locale determines
character types. This option has no effect if the stronger
`--dictionary-order` (`-d`) option is also given.

‘`-M`’  
‘`--month-sort`’  
‘`--sort=month`’  
<span id="index-_002dM"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dmonth_002dsort"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dsort-2"></span> <span
id="index-months_002c-sorting-by"></span> <span
id="index-LC_005fTIME-1"></span>

An initial string, consisting of any amount of blanks, followed by a
month name abbreviation, is folded to UPPER case and compared in the
order ‘`JAN`’ \< ‘`FEB`’ \< … \< ‘`DEC`’. Invalid names compare low to
valid names. The `LC_TIME` locale category determines the month
spellings. By default a blank is a space or a tab, but the `LC_CTYPE`
locale can change this.

‘`-n`’  
‘`--numeric-sort`’  
‘`--sort=numeric`’  
<span id="index-_002dn-7"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dnumeric_002dsort"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dsort-3"></span> <span
id="index-numeric-sort"></span> <span
id="index-LC_005fNUMERIC-4"></span>

Sort numerically. The number begins each line and consists of optional
blanks, an optional ‘`-`’ sign, and zero or more digits possibly
separated by thousands separators, optionally followed by a
decimal-point character and zero or more digits. An empty number is
treated as ‘`0`’. The `LC_NUMERIC` locale specifies the decimal-point
character and thousands separator. By default a blank is a space or a
tab, but the `LC_CTYPE` locale can change this.

Comparison is exact; there is no rounding error.

Neither a leading ‘`+`’ nor exponential notation is recognized. To
compare such strings numerically, use the `--general-numeric-sort`
(`-g`) option.

‘`-V`’  
‘`--version-sort`’  
<span id="index-_002dV"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dversion_002dsort"></span> <span
id="index-version-number-sort"></span>

Sort by version name and number. It behaves like a standard sort, except
that each sequence of decimal digits is treated numerically as an
index/version number. (See [Version sort
ordering](#Version-sort-ordering).)

‘`-r`’  
‘`--reverse`’  
<span id="index-_002dr-3"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dreverse"></span> <span
id="index-reverse-sorting"></span>

Reverse the result of comparison, so that lines with greater key values
appear earlier in the output instead of later.

‘`-R`’  
‘`--random-sort`’  
‘`--sort=random`’  
<span id="index-_002dR"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002drandom_002dsort"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dsort-4"></span> <span id="index-random-sort"></span>

Sort by hashing the input keys and then sorting the hash values. Choose
the hash function at random, ensuring that it is free of collisions so
that differing keys have differing hash values. This is like a random
permutation of the inputs (see [shuf invocation](#shuf-invocation)),
except that keys with the same value sort together.

If multiple random sort fields are specified, the same random hash
function is used for all fields. To use different random hash functions
for different fields, you can invoke `sort` more than once.

The choice of hash function is affected by the `--random-source` option.

Other options are:

‘`--compress-program=prog`’  
Compress any temporary files with the program `prog`.

With no arguments, `prog` must compress standard input to standard
output, and when given the `-d` option it must decompress standard input
to standard output.

Terminate with an error if `prog` exits with nonzero status.

White space and the backslash character should not appear in `prog`;
they are reserved for future use.

‘`--files0-from=file`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dfiles0_002dfrom_003dfile-1"></span>

Disallow processing files named on the command line, and instead process
those named in file `file`; each name being terminated by a zero byte
(ASCII NUL). This is useful when the list of file names is so long that
it may exceed a command line length limitation. In such cases, running
`sort` via `xargs` is undesirable because it splits the list into pieces
and makes `sort` print sorted output for each sublist rather than for
the entire list. One way to produce a list of ASCII NUL terminated file
names is with GNU `find`, using its `-print0` predicate. If `file` is
‘`-`’ then the ASCII NUL terminated file names are read from standard
input.

‘`-k pos1[,pos2]`’  
‘`--key=pos1[,pos2]`’  
<span id="index-_002dk-2"></span> <span id="index-_002d_002dkey"></span>
<span id="index-sort-field"></span>

Specify a sort field that consists of the part of the line between
`pos1` and `pos2` (or the end of the line, if `pos2` is omitted),
*inclusive*.

In its simplest form `pos` specifies a field number (starting with 1),
with fields being separated by runs of blank characters, and by default
those blanks being included in the comparison at the start of each
field. To adjust the handling of blank characters see the `-b` and `-t`
options.

More generally, each `pos` has the form ‘`f[.c][opts]`’, where `f` is
the number of the field to use, and `c` is the number of the first
character from the beginning of the field. Fields and character
positions are numbered starting with 1; a character position of zero in
`pos2` indicates the field’s last character. If ‘`.c`’ is omitted from
`pos1`, it defaults to 1 (the beginning of the field); if omitted from
`pos2`, it defaults to 0 (the end of the field). `opts` are ordering
options, allowing individual keys to be sorted according to different
rules; see below for details. Keys can span multiple fields.

Example: To sort on the second field, use `--key=2,2` (`-k 2,2`). See
below for more notes on keys and more examples. See also the `--debug`
option to help determine the part of the line being used in the sort.

‘`--debug`’  
Highlight the portion of each line used for sorting. Also issue warnings
about questionable usage to standard error.

‘`--batch-size=nmerge`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dbatch_002dsize"></span> <span
id="index-number-of-inputs-to-merge_002c-nmerge"></span>

Merge at most `nmerge` inputs at once.

When `sort` has to merge more than `nmerge` inputs, it merges them in
groups of `nmerge`, saving the result in a temporary file, which is then
used as an input in a subsequent merge.

A large value of `nmerge` may improve merge performance and decrease
temporary storage utilization at the expense of increased memory usage
and I/O. Conversely a small value of `nmerge` may reduce memory
requirements and I/O at the expense of temporary storage consumption and
merge performance.

The value of `nmerge` must be at least 2. The default value is currently
16, but this is implementation-dependent and may change in the future.

The value of `nmerge` may be bounded by a resource limit for open file
descriptors. The commands ‘`ulimit -n`’ or ‘`getconf OPEN_MAX`’ may
display limits for your systems; these limits may be modified further if
your program already has some files open, or if the operating system has
other limits on the number of open files. If the value of `nmerge`
exceeds the resource limit, `sort` silently uses a smaller value.

‘`-o output-file`’  
‘`--output=output-file`’  
<span id="index-_002do-2"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002doutput"></span> <span
id="index-overwriting-of-input_002c-allowed"></span>

Write output to `output-file` instead of standard output. Normally,
`sort` reads all input before opening `output-file`, so you can sort a
file in place by using commands like `sort -o F F` and
`cat F | sort -o F`. However, it is often safer to output to an
otherwise-unused file, as data may be lost if the system crashes or
`sort` encounters an I/O or other serious error while a file is being
sorted in place. Also, `sort` with `--merge` (`-m`) can open the output
file before reading all input, so a command like
`cat F | sort -m -o F - G` is not safe as `sort` might start writing `F`
before `cat` is done reading it.

<span id="index-POSIXLY_005fCORRECT-3"></span>

On newer systems, `-o` cannot appear after an input file if
`POSIXLY_CORRECT` is set, e.g., ‘`sort F -o F`’. Portable scripts should
specify `-o output-file` before any input files.

‘`--random-source=file`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002drandom_002dsource"></span> <span
id="index-random-source-for-sorting"></span>

Use `file` as a source of random data used to determine which random
hash function to use with the `-R` option. See [Random
sources](#Random-sources).

‘`-s`’  
‘`--stable`’  
<span id="index-_002ds-10"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dstable"></span> <span
id="index-sort-stability-1"></span> <span
id="index-sort_0027s-last_002dresort-comparison-1"></span>

Make `sort` stable by disabling its last-resort comparison. This option
has no effect if no fields or global ordering options other than
`--reverse` (`-r`) are specified.

‘`-S size`’  
‘`--buffer-size=size`’  
<span id="index-_002dS-3"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dbuffer_002dsize"></span> <span
id="index-size-for-main-memory-sorting"></span>

Use a main-memory sort buffer of the given `size`. By default, `size` is
in units of 1024 bytes. Appending ‘`%`’ causes `size` to be interpreted
as a percentage of physical memory. Appending ‘`K`’ multiplies `size` by
1024 (the default), ‘`M`’ by 1,048,576, ‘`G`’ by 1,073,741,824, and so
on for ‘`T`’, ‘`P`’, ‘`E`’, ‘`Z`’, and ‘`Y`’. Appending ‘`b`’ causes
`size` to be interpreted as a byte count, with no multiplication.

This option can improve the performance of `sort` by causing it to start
with a larger or smaller sort buffer than the default. However, this
option affects only the initial buffer size. The buffer grows beyond
`size` if `sort` encounters input lines larger than `size`.

‘`-t separator`’  
‘`--field-separator=separator`’  
<span id="index-_002dt-6"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dfield_002dseparator"></span> <span
id="index-field-separator-character"></span>

Use character `separator` as the field separator when finding the sort
keys in each line. By default, fields are separated by the empty string
between a non-blank character and a blank character. By default a blank
is a space or a tab, but the `LC_CTYPE` locale can change this.

That is, given the input line ‘` foo bar`’, `sort` breaks it into fields
‘` foo`’ and ‘` bar`’. The field separator is not considered to be part
of either the field preceding or the field following, so with
‘`sort -t " "`’ the same input line has three fields: an empty field,
‘`foo`’, and ‘`bar`’. However, fields that extend to the end of the
line, as `-k 2`, or fields consisting of a range, as `-k 2,3`, retain
the field separators present between the endpoints of the range.

To specify ASCII NUL as the field separator, use the two-character
string ‘`\0`’, e.g., ‘`sort -t '\0'`’.

‘`-T tempdir`’  
‘`--temporary-directory=tempdir`’  
<span id="index-_002dT-2"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dtemporary_002ddirectory"></span> <span
id="index-temporary-directory"></span> <span id="index-TMPDIR-1"></span>

Use directory `tempdir` to store temporary files, overriding the
`TMPDIR` environment variable. If this option is given more than once,
temporary files are stored in all the directories given. If you have a
large sort or merge that is I/O-bound, you can often improve performance
by using this option to specify directories on different file systems.

‘`--parallel=n`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dparallel"></span> <span
id="index-multithreaded-sort"></span>

Set the number of sorts run in parallel to `n`. By default, `n` is set
to the number of available processors, but limited to 8, as there are
diminishing performance gains after that. Note also that using `n`
threads increases the memory usage by a factor of log `n`. Also see
[nproc invocation](#nproc-invocation).

‘`-u`’  
‘`--unique`’  
<span id="index-_002du-3"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dunique"></span> <span
id="index-uniquifying-output"></span>

Normally, output only the first of a sequence of lines that compare
equal. For the `--check` (`-c` or `-C`) option, check that no pair of
consecutive lines compares equal.

This option also disables the default last-resort comparison.

The commands `sort -u` and `sort | uniq` are equivalent, but this
equivalence does not extend to arbitrary `sort` options. For example,
`sort -n -u` inspects only the value of the initial numeric string when
checking for uniqueness, whereas `sort -n | uniq` inspects the entire
line. See [uniq invocation](#uniq-invocation).

‘`-z`’  
‘`--zero-terminated`’  
<span id="index-_002dz-4"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dzero_002dterminated-2"></span> <span
id="index-process-zero_002dterminated-items-2"></span>

Delimit items with a zero byte rather than a newline (ASCII LF). I.e.,
treat input as items separated by ASCII NUL and terminate output items
with ASCII NUL. This option can be useful in conjunction with
‘`perl -0`’ or ‘`find -print0`’ and ‘`xargs -0`’ which do the same in
order to reliably handle arbitrary file names (even those containing
blanks or other special characters).

Historical (BSD and System V) implementations of `sort` have differed in
their interpretation of some options, particularly `-b`, `-f`, and `-n`.
GNU sort follows the POSIX behavior, which is usually (but not always!)
like the System V behavior. According to POSIX, `-n` no longer implies
`-b`. For consistency, `-M` has been changed in the same way. This may
affect the meaning of character positions in field specifications in
obscure cases. The only fix is to add an explicit `-b`.

A position in a sort field specified with `-k` may have any of the
option letters ‘`MbdfghinRrV`’ appended to it, in which case no global
ordering options are inherited by that particular field. The `-b` option
may be independently attached to either or both of the start and end
positions of a field specification, and if it is inherited from the
global options it will be attached to both. If input lines can contain
leading or adjacent blanks and `-t` is not used, then `-k` is typically
combined with `-b` or an option that implicitly ignores leading blanks
(‘`Mghn`’) as otherwise the varying numbers of leading blanks in fields
can cause confusing results.

If the start position in a sort field specifier falls after the end of
the line or after the end field, the field is empty. If the `-b` option
was specified, the ‘`.c`’ part of a field specification is counted from
the first nonblank character of the field.

<span id="index-_005fPOSIX2_005fVERSION-2"></span> <span
id="index-POSIXLY_005fCORRECT-4"></span>

On systems not conforming to POSIX 1003.1-2001, `sort` supports a
traditional origin-zero syntax ‘`+pos1 [-pos2]`’ for specifying sort
keys. The traditional command ‘`sort +a.x -b.y`’ is equivalent to
‘`sort -k a+1.x+1,b`’ if `y` is ‘`0`’ or absent, otherwise it is
equivalent to ‘`sort -k a+1.x+1,b+1.y`’.

This traditional behavior can be controlled with the `_POSIX2_VERSION`
environment variable (see [Standards
conformance](#Standards-conformance)); it can also be enabled when
`POSIXLY_CORRECT` is not set by using the traditional syntax with
‘`-pos2`’ present.

Scripts intended for use on standard hosts should avoid traditional
syntax and should use `-k` instead. For example, avoid ‘`sort +2`’,
since it might be interpreted as either ‘`sort ./+2`’ or ‘`sort -k 3`’.
If your script must also run on hosts that support only the traditional
syntax, it can use a test like
‘`if sort -k 1 </dev/null >/dev/null 2>&1; then …`’ to decide which
syntax to use.

Here are some examples to illustrate various combinations of options.

-   Sort in descending (reverse) numeric order.
    <div class="example">

    ``` example
    sort -n -r
    ```

    </div>

-   Run no more than 4 sorts concurrently, using a buffer size of 10M.
    <div class="example">

    ``` example
    sort --parallel=4 -S 10M
    ```

    </div>

-   Sort alphabetically, omitting the first and second fields and the
    blanks at the start of the third field. This uses a single key
    composed of the characters beginning at the start of the first
    nonblank character in field three and extending to the end of each
    line.
    <div class="example">

    ``` example
    sort -k 3b
    ```

    </div>

-   Sort numerically on the second field and resolve ties by sorting
    alphabetically on the third and fourth characters of field five. Use
    ‘`:`’ as the field delimiter.

    <div class="example">

    ``` example
    sort -t : -k 2,2n -k 5.3,5.4
    ```

    </div>

    Note that if you had written `-k 2n` instead of `-k 2,2n` `sort`
    would have used all characters beginning in the second field and
    extending to the end of the line as the primary *numeric* key. For
    the large majority of applications, treating keys spanning more than
    one field as numeric will not do what you expect.

    Also note that the ‘`n`’ modifier was applied to the field-end
    specifier for the first key. It would have been equivalent to
    specify `-k 2n,2` or `-k 2n,2n`. All modifiers except ‘`b`’ apply to
    the associated *field*, regardless of whether the modifier character
    is attached to the field-start and/or the field-end part of the key
    specifier.

-   Sort the password file on the fifth field and ignore any leading
    blanks. Sort lines with equal values in field five on the numeric
    user ID in field three. Fields are separated by ‘`:`’.

    <div class="example">

    ``` example
    sort -t : -k 5b,5 -k 3,3n /etc/passwd
    sort -t : -n -k 5b,5 -k 3,3 /etc/passwd
    sort -t : -b -k 5,5 -k 3,3n /etc/passwd
    ```

    </div>

    These three commands have equivalent effect. The first specifies
    that the first key’s start position ignores leading blanks and the
    second key is sorted numerically. The other two commands rely on
    global options being inherited by sort keys that lack modifiers. The
    inheritance works in this case because `-k 5b,5b` and `-k 5b,5` are
    equivalent, as the location of a field-end lacking a ‘`.c`’
    character position is not affected by whether initial blanks are
    skipped.

-   Sort a set of log files, primarily by IPv4 address and secondarily
    by timestamp. If two lines’ primary and secondary keys are
    identical, output the lines in the same order that they were input.
    The log files contain lines that look like this:

    <div class="example">

    ``` example
    4.150.156.3 - - [01/Apr/2020:06:31:51 +0000] message 1
    211.24.3.231 - - [24/Apr/2020:20:17:39 +0000] message 2
    ```

    </div>

    Fields are separated by exactly one space. Sort IPv4 addresses
    lexicographically, e.g., 212.61.52.2 sorts before 212.129.233.201
    because 61 is less than 129.

    <div class="example">

    ``` example
    sort -s -t ' ' -k 4.9n -k 4.5M -k 4.2n -k 4.14,4.21 file*.log |
    sort -s -t '.' -k 1,1n -k 2,2n -k 3,3n -k 4,4n
    ```

    </div>

    This example cannot be done with a single `sort` invocation, since
    IPv4 address components are separated by ‘`.`’ while dates come just
    after a space. So it is broken down into two invocations of `sort`:
    the first sorts by timestamp and the second by IPv4 address. The
    timestamp is sorted by year, then month, then day, and finally by
    hour-minute-second field, using `-k` to isolate each field. Except
    for hour-minute-second there’s no need to specify the end of each
    key field, since the ‘`n`’ and ‘`M`’ modifiers sort based on leading
    prefixes that cannot cross field boundaries. The IPv4 addresses are
    sorted lexicographically. The second sort uses ‘`-s`’ so that ties
    in the primary key are broken by the secondary key; the first sort
    uses ‘`-s`’ so that the combination of the two sorts is stable.

-   Generate a tags file in case-insensitive sorted order.

    <div class="example">

    ``` example
    find src -type f -print0 | sort -z -f | xargs -0 etags --append
    ```

    </div>

    The use of `-print0`, `-z`, and `-0` in this case means that file
    names that contain blanks or other special characters are not broken
    up by the sort operation.

-   Use the common DSU, Decorate Sort Undecorate idiom to sort lines
    according to their length.

    <div class="example">

    ``` example
    awk '{print length, $0}' /etc/passwd | sort -n | cut -f2- -d' '
    ```

    </div>

    In general this technique can be used to sort data that the `sort`
    command does not support, or is inefficient at, sorting directly.

-   Shuffle a list of directories, but preserve the order of files
    within each directory. For instance, one could use this to generate
    a music playlist in which albums are shuffled but the songs of each
    album are played in order.
    <div class="example">

    ``` example
    ls */* | sort -t / -k 1,1R -k 2,2
    ```

    </div>

<span id="shuf_003a-Shuffling-text"></span>

### 7.2 `shuf`: Shuffling text

<span id="index-shuf"></span> <span id="index-shuffling-files"></span>

`shuf` shuffles its input by outputting a random permutation of its
input lines. Each output permutation is equally likely. Synopses:

<div class="example">

``` example
shuf [option]… [file]
shuf -e [option]… [arg]…
shuf -i lo-hi [option]…
```

</div>

`shuf` has three modes of operation that affect where it obtains its
input lines. By default, it reads lines from standard input. The
following options change the operation mode:

‘`-e`’  
‘`--echo`’  
<span id="index-_002dc-8"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002decho"></span> <span
id="index-command_002dline-operands-to-shuffle"></span>

Treat each command-line operand as an input line.

‘`-i lo-hi`’  
‘`--input-range=lo-hi`’  
<span id="index-_002di-5"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dinput_002drange"></span> <span
id="index-input-range-to-shuffle"></span>

Act as if input came from a file containing the range of unsigned
decimal integers `lo`…`hi`, one per line.

`shuf`’s other options can affect its behavior in all operation modes:

‘`-n count`’  
‘`--head-count=count`’  
<span id="index-_002dn-8"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dhead_002dcount"></span> <span
id="index-head-of-output"></span>

Output at most `count` lines. By default, all input lines are output.

‘`-o output-file`’  
‘`--output=output-file`’  
<span id="index-_002do-3"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002doutput-1"></span> <span
id="index-overwriting-of-input_002c-allowed-1"></span>

Write output to `output-file` instead of standard output. `shuf` reads
all input before opening `output-file`, so you can safely shuffle a file
in place by using commands like `shuf -o F <F` and `cat F | shuf -o F`.

‘`--random-source=file`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002drandom_002dsource-1"></span> <span
id="index-random-source-for-shuffling"></span>

Use `file` as a source of random data used to determine which
permutation to generate. See [Random sources](#Random-sources).

‘`-r`’  
‘`--repeat`’  
<span id="index-_002dr-4"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002drepeat"></span> <span
id="index-repeat-output-values"></span>

Repeat output values, that is, select with replacement. With this option
the output is not a permutation of the input; instead, each output line
is randomly chosen from all the inputs. This option is typically
combined with `--head-count`; if `--head-count` is not given, `shuf`
repeats indefinitely.

‘`-z`’  
‘`--zero-terminated`’  
<span id="index-_002dz-5"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dzero_002dterminated-3"></span> <span
id="index-process-zero_002dterminated-items-3"></span>

Delimit items with a zero byte rather than a newline (ASCII LF). I.e.,
treat input as items separated by ASCII NUL and terminate output items
with ASCII NUL. This option can be useful in conjunction with
‘`perl -0`’ or ‘`find -print0`’ and ‘`xargs -0`’ which do the same in
order to reliably handle arbitrary file names (even those containing
blanks or other special characters).

For example:

<div class="example">

``` example
shuf <<EOF
A man,
a plan,
a canal:
Panama!
EOF
```

</div>

might produce the output

<div class="example">

``` example
Panama!
A man,
a canal:
a plan,
```

</div>

Similarly, the command:

<div class="example">

``` example
shuf -e clubs hearts diamonds spades
```

</div>

might output:

<div class="example">

``` example
clubs
diamonds
spades
hearts
```

</div>

and the command ‘`shuf -i 1-4`’ might output:

<div class="example">

``` example
4
2
1
3
```

</div>

The above examples all have four input lines, so `shuf` might produce
any of the twenty-four possible permutations of the input. In general,
if there are `n` input lines, there are `n`! (i.e., `n` factorial, or
`n` \* (`n` - 1) \* … \* 1) possible output permutations.

To output 50 random numbers each in the range 0 through 9, use:

<div class="example">

``` example
shuf -r -n 50 -i 0-9
```

</div>

To simulate 100 coin flips, use:

<div class="example">

``` example
shuf -r -n 100 -e Head Tail
```

</div>

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

<span id="uniq_003a-Uniquify-files"></span>

### 7.3 `uniq`: Uniquify files

<span id="index-uniq"></span> <span id="index-uniquify-files"></span>

`uniq` writes the unique lines in the given `input`, or standard input
if nothing is given or for an `input` name of ‘`-`’. Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
uniq [option]… [input [output]]
```

</div>

By default, `uniq` prints its input lines, except that it discards all
but the first of adjacent repeated lines, so that no output lines are
repeated. Optionally, it can instead discard lines that are not
repeated, or all repeated lines.

The input need not be sorted, but repeated input lines are detected only
if they are adjacent. If you want to discard non-adjacent duplicate
lines, perhaps you want to use `sort -u`. See [sort
invocation](#sort-invocation).

<span id="index-LC_005fCOLLATE-1"></span>

Comparisons honor the rules specified by the `LC_COLLATE` locale
category.

If no `output` file is specified, `uniq` writes to standard output.

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`-f n`’  
‘`--skip-fields=n`’  
<span id="index-_002df-6"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dskip_002dfields"></span>

Skip `n` fields on each line before checking for uniqueness. Use a null
string for comparison if a line has fewer than `n` fields. Fields are
sequences of non-space non-tab characters that are separated from each
other by at least one space or tab.

For compatibility `uniq` supports a traditional option syntax `-n`. New
scripts should use `-f n` instead.

‘`-s n`’  
‘`--skip-chars=n`’  
<span id="index-_002ds-11"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dskip_002dchars"></span>

Skip `n` characters before checking for uniqueness. Use a null string
for comparison if a line has fewer than `n` characters. If you use both
the field and character skipping options, fields are skipped over first.

<span id="index-_005fPOSIX2_005fVERSION-3"></span>

On systems not conforming to POSIX 1003.1-2001, `uniq` supports a
traditional option syntax `+n`. Although this traditional behavior can
be controlled with the `_POSIX2_VERSION` environment variable (see
[Standards conformance](#Standards-conformance)), portable scripts
should avoid commands whose behavior depends on this variable. For
example, use ‘`uniq ./+10`’ or ‘`uniq -s 10`’ rather than the ambiguous
‘`uniq +10`’.

‘`-c`’  
‘`--count`’  
<span id="index-_002dc-9"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dcount"></span>

Print the number of times each line occurred along with the line.

‘`-i`’  
‘`--ignore-case`’  
<span id="index-_002di-6"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dignore_002dcase-1"></span>

Ignore differences in case when comparing lines.

‘`-d`’  
‘`--repeated`’  
<span id="index-_002dd-6"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002drepeated"></span> <span
id="index-repeated-lines_002c-outputting"></span>

Discard lines that are not repeated. When used by itself, this option
causes `uniq` to print the first copy of each repeated line, and nothing
else.

‘`-D`’  
‘`--all-repeated[=delimit-method]`’  
<span id="index-_002dD"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dall_002drepeated"></span> <span
id="index-all-repeated-lines_002c-outputting"></span>

Do not discard the second and subsequent repeated input lines, but
discard lines that are not repeated. This option is useful mainly in
conjunction with other options e.g., to ignore case or to compare only
selected fields. The optional `delimit-method`, supported with the long
form option, specifies how to delimit groups of repeated lines, and must
be one of the following:

‘`none`’  
Do not delimit groups of repeated lines. This is equivalent to
`--all-repeated` (`-D`).

‘`prepend`’  
Output a newline before each group of repeated lines. With
`--zero-terminated` (`-z`), use a zero byte (ASCII NUL) instead of a
newline as the delimiter.

‘`separate`’  
Separate groups of repeated lines with a single newline. This is the
same as using ‘`prepend`’, except that no delimiter is inserted before
the first group, and hence may be better suited for output direct to
users. With `--zero-terminated` (`-z`), use a zero byte (ASCII NUL)
instead of a newline as the delimiter.

Note that when groups are delimited and the input stream contains blank
lines, then the output is ambiguous. To avoid that, filter the input
through ‘`tr -s '\n'`’ to remove blank lines.

This is a GNU extension.

‘`--group[=delimit-method]`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dgroup"></span> <span
id="index-all-lines_002c-grouping"></span>

Output all lines, and delimit each unique group. With
`--zero-terminated` (`-z`), use a zero byte (ASCII NUL) instead of a
newline as the delimiter. The optional `delimit-method` specifies how to
delimit groups, and must be one of the following:

‘`separate`’  
Separate unique groups with a single delimiter. This is the default
delimiting method if none is specified, and better suited for output
direct to users.

‘`prepend`’  
Output a delimiter before each group of unique items.

‘`append`’  
Output a delimiter after each group of unique items.

‘`both`’  
Output a delimiter around each group of unique items.

Note that when groups are delimited and the input stream contains blank
lines, then the output is ambiguous. To avoid that, filter the input
through ‘`tr -s '\n'`’ to remove blank lines.

This is a GNU extension.

‘`-u`’  
‘`--unique`’  
<span id="index-_002du-4"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dunique-1"></span> <span
id="index-unique-lines_002c-outputting"></span>

Discard the last line that would be output for a repeated input group.
When used by itself, this option causes `uniq` to print unique lines,
and nothing else.

‘`-w n`’  
‘`--check-chars=n`’  
<span id="index-_002dw-8"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dcheck_002dchars"></span>

Compare at most `n` characters on each line (after skipping any
specified fields and characters). By default the entire rest of the
lines are compared.

‘`-z`’  
‘`--zero-terminated`’  
<span id="index-_002dz-6"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dzero_002dterminated-4"></span> <span
id="index-process-zero_002dterminated-items-4"></span>

Delimit items with a zero byte rather than a newline (ASCII LF). I.e.,
treat input as items separated by ASCII NUL and terminate output items
with ASCII NUL. This option can be useful in conjunction with
‘`perl -0`’ or ‘`find -print0`’ and ‘`xargs -0`’ which do the same in
order to reliably handle arbitrary file names (even those containing
blanks or other special characters). Note with `-z` the newline
character is treated as a field separator.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

### 7.4 `comm`: Compare two sorted files line by line

<span id="index-comm"></span> <span
id="index-line_002dby_002dline-comparison"></span> <span
id="index-comparing-sorted-files"></span>

`comm` writes to standard output lines that are common, and lines that
are unique, to two input files; a file name of ‘`-`’ means standard
input. Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
comm [option]… file1 file2
```

</div>

<span id="index-LC_005fCOLLATE-2"></span>

Before `comm` can be used, the input files must be sorted using the
collating sequence specified by the `LC_COLLATE` locale. If an input
file ends in a non-newline character, a newline is silently appended.
The `sort` command with no options always outputs a file that is
suitable input to `comm`.

<span id="index-differing-lines"></span> <span
id="index-common-lines"></span>

With no options, `comm` produces three-column output. Column one
contains lines unique to `file1`, column two contains lines unique to
`file2`, and column three contains lines common to both files. Columns
are separated by a single TAB character.

<span id="index-_002d1"></span> <span id="index-_002d2"></span> <span
id="index-_002d3"></span>

The options `-1`, `-2`, and `-3` suppress printing of the corresponding
columns (and separators). Also see [Common options](#Common-options).

Unlike some other comparison utilities, `comm` has an exit status that
does not depend on the result of the comparison. Upon normal completion
`comm` produces an exit code of zero. If there is an error it exits with
nonzero status.

If the `--check-order` option is given, unsorted inputs will cause a
fatal error message. If the option `--nocheck-order` is given, unsorted
inputs will never cause an error message. If neither of these options is
given, wrongly sorted inputs are diagnosed only if an input file is
found to contain unpairable lines. If an input file is diagnosed as
being unsorted, the `comm` command will exit with a nonzero status (and
the output should not be used).

Forcing `comm` to process wrongly sorted input files containing
unpairable lines by specifying `--nocheck-order` is not guaranteed to
produce any particular output. The output will probably not correspond
with whatever you hoped it would be.

‘`--check-order`’  
Fail with an error message if either input file is wrongly ordered.

‘`--nocheck-order`’  
Do not check that both input files are in sorted order.

Other options are:

‘`--output-delimiter=str`’  
Print `str` between adjacent output columns, rather than the default of
a single TAB character.

The delimiter `str` may not be empty.

‘`--total`’  
Output a summary at the end.

Similar to the regular output, column one contains the total number of
lines unique to `file1`, column two contains the total number of lines
unique to `file2`, and column three contains the total number of lines
common to both files, followed by the word ‘`total`’ in the additional
column four.

In the following example, `comm` omits the regular output (`-123`), thus
just printing the summary:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ printf '%s\n' a b c d e     > file1
$ printf '%s\n'   b c d e f g > file2
$ comm --total -123 file1 file2
1       2       4       total
```

</div>

This option is a GNU extension. Portable scripts should use `wc` to get
the totals, e.g. for the above example files:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ comm -23 file1 file2 | wc -l    # number of lines only in file1
1
$ comm -13 file1 file2 | wc -l    # number of lines only in file2
2
$ comm -12 file1 file2 | wc -l    # number of lines common to both files
4
```

</div>

‘`-z`’  
‘`--zero-terminated`’  
<span id="index-_002dz-7"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dzero_002dterminated-5"></span> <span
id="index-process-zero_002dterminated-items-5"></span>

Delimit items with a zero byte rather than a newline (ASCII LF). I.e.,
treat input as items separated by ASCII NUL and terminate output items
with ASCII NUL. This option can be useful in conjunction with
‘`perl -0`’ or ‘`find -print0`’ and ‘`xargs -0`’ which do the same in
order to reliably handle arbitrary file names (even those containing
blanks or other special characters).

<span id="ptx_003a-Produce-permuted-indexes"></span>

### 7.5 `ptx`: Produce permuted indexes

<span id="index-ptx"></span>

`ptx` reads a text file and essentially produces a permuted index, with
each keyword in its context. The calling sketch is either one of:

<div class="example">

``` example
ptx [option …] [file …]
ptx -G [option …] [input [output]]
```

</div>

The `-G` (or its equivalent: `--traditional`) option disables all GNU
extensions and reverts to traditional mode, thus introducing some
limitations and changing several of the program’s default option values.
When `-G` is not specified, GNU extensions are always enabled. GNU
extensions to `ptx` are documented wherever appropriate in this
document. See [Compatibility in ptx](#Compatibility-in-ptx), for the
full list.

Individual options are explained in the following sections.

When GNU extensions are enabled, there may be zero, one or several
`file`s after the options. If there is no `file`, the program reads the
standard input. If there is one or several `file`s, they give the name
of input files which are all read in turn, as if all the input files
were concatenated. However, there is a full contextual break between
each file and, when automatic referencing is requested, file names and
line numbers refer to individual text input files. In all cases, the
program outputs the permuted index to the standard output.

When GNU extensions are *not* enabled, that is, when the program
operates in traditional mode, there may be zero, one or two parameters
besides the options. If there are no parameters, the program reads the
standard input and outputs the permuted index to the standard output. If
there is only one parameter, it names the text `input` to be read
instead of the standard input. If two parameters are given, they give
respectively the name of the `input` file to read and the name of the
`output` file to produce. *Be very careful* to note that, in this case,
the contents of file given by the second parameter is destroyed. This
behavior is dictated by System V `ptx` compatibility; GNU Standards
normally discourage output parameters not introduced by an option.

Note that for *any* file named as the value of an option or as an input
text file, a single dash ‘`-`’ may be used, in which case standard input
is assumed. However, it would not make sense to use this convention more
than once per program invocation.

<span id="Charset-selection"></span>

#### 7.5.2 Charset selection

As it is set up now, `ptx` assumes that the input file is coded using
8-bit characters, and it may not work well in multibyte locales. In a
single-byte locale, the default regular expression for a keyword allows
foreign or diacriticized letters. Keyword sorting, however, is still
crude; it obeys the underlying character set ordering quite blindly.

The output of `ptx` assumes the locale’s character encoding. For
example, with `ptx`’s `-T` option, if the locale uses the Latin-1
encoding you may need a LaTeX directive like
‘`\usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}`’ to render non-ASCII characters
correctly.

‘`--ignore-case`’  
<span id="index-_002df-7"></span> <span

<span id="Word-selection-and-input-processing"></span>

#### 7.5.3 Word selection and input processing

‘`-b file`’  
‘`--break-file=file`’  
<span id="index-_002db-10"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dbreak_002dfile"></span>

This option provides an alternative (to `-W`) method of describing which
characters make up words. It introduces the name of a file which
contains a list of characters which can*not* be part of one word; this
file is called the *Break file*. Any character which is not part of the
Break file is a word constituent. If both options `-b` and `-W` are
specified, then `-W` has precedence and `-b` is ignored.

When GNU extensions are enabled, the only way to avoid newline as a
break character is to write all the break characters in the file with no
newline at all, not even at the end of the file. When GNU extensions are
disabled, spaces, tabs and newlines are always considered as break
characters even if not included in the Break file.

‘`-i file`’  
‘`--ignore-file=file`’  
<span id="index-_002di-7"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dignore_002dfile"></span>

The file associated with this option contains a list of words which will
never be taken as keywords in concordance output. It is called the
*Ignore file*. The file contains exactly one word in each line; the end
of line separation of words is not subject to the value of the `-S`
option.

‘`-o file`’  
‘`--only-file=file`’  
<span id="index-_002do-4"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002donly_002dfile"></span>

The file associated with this option contains a list of words which will
be retained in concordance output; any word not mentioned in this file
is ignored. The file is called the *Only file*. The file contains
exactly one word in each line; the end of line separation of words is
not subject to the value of the `-S` option.

There is no default for the Only file. When both an Only file and an
Ignore file are specified, a word is considered a keyword only if it is
listed in the Only file and not in the Ignore file.

‘`-r`’  
‘`--references`’  
<span id="index-_002dr-5"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dreferences"></span>

On each input line, the leading sequence of non-white space characters
will be taken to be a reference that has the purpose of identifying this
input line in the resulting permuted index. See [Output formatting in
ptx](#Output-formatting-in-ptx), for more information about reference
production. Using this option changes the default value for option `-S`.

Using this option, the program does not try very hard to remove
references from contexts in output, but it succeeds in doing so *when*
the context ends exactly at the newline. If option `-r` is used with
`-S` default value, or when GNU extensions are disabled, this condition
is always met and references are completely excluded from the output
contexts.

‘`-S regexp`’  
‘`--sentence-regexp=regexp`’  
<span id="index-_002dS-4"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dsentence_002dregexp"></span>

This option selects which regular expression will describe the end of a
line or the end of a sentence. In fact, this regular expression is not
the only distinction between end of lines or end of sentences, and input
line boundaries have no special significance outside this option. By
default, when GNU extensions are enabled and if `-r` option is not used,
end of sentences are used. In this case, this `regex` is imported from
GNU Emacs:

<div class="example">

``` example
[.?!][]\"')}]*\\($\\|\t\\|  \\)[ \t\n]*
```

</div>

Whenever GNU extensions are disabled or if `-r` option is used, end of
lines are used; in this case, the default `regexp` is just:

<div class="example">

``` example
\n
```

</div>

Using an empty `regexp` is equivalent to completely disabling end of
line or end of sentence recognition. In this case, the whole file is
considered to be a single big line or sentence. The user might want to
disallow all truncation flag generation as well, through option `-F ""`.
See [Syntax of Regular
Expressions](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/emacs.html#Regexps)
in The GNU Emacs Manual.

When the keywords happen to be near the beginning of the input line or
sentence, this often creates an unused area at the beginning of the
output context line; when the keywords happen to be near the end of the
input line or sentence, this often creates an unused area at the end of
the output context line. The program tries to fill those unused areas by
wrapping around context in them; the tail of the input line or sentence
is used to fill the unused area on the left of the output line; the head
of the input line or sentence is used to fill the unused area on the
right of the output line.

As a matter of convenience to the user, many usual backslashed escape
sequences from the C language are recognized and converted to the
corresponding characters by `ptx` itself.

‘`-W regexp`’  
‘`--word-regexp=regexp`’  
<span id="index-_002dW-1"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dword_002dregexp"></span>

This option selects which regular expression will describe each keyword.
By default, if GNU extensions are enabled, a word is a sequence of
letters; the `regexp` used is ‘`\w+`’. When GNU extensions are disabled,
a word is by default anything which ends with a space, a tab or a
newline; the `regexp` used is ‘`[^ \t\n]+`’.

An empty `regexp` is equivalent to not using this option. See [Syntax of
Regular
Expressions](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/emacs.html#Regexps)
in The GNU Emacs Manual.

As a matter of convenience to the user, many usual backslashed escape
sequences, as found in the C language, are recognized and converted to
the corresponding characters by `ptx` itself.

<span id="Output-formatting"></span>

#### 7.5.4 Output formatting

Output format is mainly controlled by the `-O` and `-T` options
described in the table below. When neither `-O` nor `-T` are selected,
and if GNU extensions are enabled, the program chooses an output format
suitable for a dumb terminal. Each keyword occurrence is output to the
center of one line, surrounded by its left and right contexts. Each
field is properly justified, so the concordance output can be readily
observed. As a special feature, if automatic references are selected by
option `-A` and are output before the left context, that is, if option
`-R` is *not* selected, then a colon is added after the reference; this
nicely interfaces with GNU Emacs `next-error` processing. In this
default output format, each white space character, like newline and tab,
is merely changed to exactly one space, with no special attempt to
compress consecutive spaces. This might change in the future. Except for
those white space characters, every other character of the underlying
set of 256 characters is transmitted verbatim.

Output format is further controlled by the following options.

‘`-g number`’  
‘`--gap-size=number`’  
<span id="index-_002dg-2"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dgap_002dsize"></span>

Select the size of the minimum white space gap between the fields on the
output line.

‘`-w number`’  
‘`--width=number`’  
<span id="index-_002dw-9"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dwidth-4"></span>

Select the maximum output width of each final line. If references are
used, they are included or excluded from the maximum output width
depending on the value of option `-R`. If this option is not selected,
that is, when references are output before the left context, the maximum
output width takes into account the maximum length of all references. If
this option is selected, that is, when references are output after the
right context, the maximum output width does not take into account the
space taken by references, nor the gap that precedes them.

‘`-A`’  
‘`--auto-reference`’  
<span id="index-_002dA-2"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dauto_002dreference"></span>

Select automatic references. Each input line will have an automatic
reference made up of the file name and the line ordinal, with a single
colon between them. However, the file name will be empty when standard
input is being read. If both `-A` and `-r` are selected, then the input
reference is still read and skipped, but the automatic reference is used
at output time, overriding the input reference.

‘`-R`’  
‘`--right-side-refs`’  
<span id="index-_002dR-1"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dright_002dside_002drefs"></span>

In the default output format, when option `-R` is not used, any
references produced by the effect of options `-r` or `-A` are placed to
the far right of output lines, after the right context. With default
output format, when the `-R` option is specified, references are rather
placed at the beginning of each output line, before the left context.
For any other output format, option `-R` is ignored, with one exception:
with `-R` the width of references is *not* taken into account in total
output width given by `-w`.

This option is automatically selected whenever GNU extensions are
disabled.

‘`-F string`’  
‘`--flag-truncation=string`’  
<span id="index-_002dF-2"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dflag_002dtruncation"></span>

This option will request that any truncation in the output be reported
using the string `string`. Most output fields theoretically extend
towards the beginning or the end of the current line, or current
sentence, as selected with option `-S`. But there is a maximum allowed
output line width, changeable through option `-w`, which is further
divided into space for various output fields. When a field has to be
truncated because it cannot extend beyond the beginning or the end of
the current line to fit in, then a truncation occurs. By default, the
string used is a single slash, as in `-F /`.

`string` may have more than one character, as in `-F …`. Also, in the
particular case when `string` is empty (`-F ""`), truncation flagging is
disabled, and no truncation marks are appended in this case.

As a matter of convenience to the user, many usual backslashed escape
sequences, as found in the C language, are recognized and converted to
the corresponding characters by `ptx` itself.

‘`-M string`’  
‘`--macro-name=string`’  
<span id="index-_002dM-1"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dmacro_002dname"></span>

Select another `string` to be used instead of ‘`xx`’, while generating
output suitable for `nroff`, `troff` or TeX.

‘`-O`’  
‘`--format=roff`’  
<span id="index-_002dO"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dformat_003droff"></span>

Choose an output format suitable for `nroff` or `troff` processing. Each
output line will look like:

<div class="example">

``` example
.xx "tail" "before" "keyword_and_after" "head" "ref"
```

</div>

so it will be possible to write a ‘`.xx`’ roff macro to take care of the
output typesetting. This is the default output format when GNU
extensions are disabled. Option `-M` can be used to change ‘`xx`’ to
another macro name.

In this output format, each non-graphical character, like newline and
tab, is merely changed to exactly one space, with no special attempt to
compress consecutive spaces. Each quote character ‘`"`’ is doubled so it
will be correctly processed by `nroff` or `troff`.

‘`-T`’  
‘`--format=tex`’  
<span id="index-_002dT-3"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dformat_003dtex"></span>

Choose an output format suitable for TeX processing. Each output line
will look like:

<div class="example">

``` example
\xx {tail}{before}{keyword}{after}{head}{ref}
```

</div>

so it will be possible to write a `\xx` definition to take care of the
output typesetting. Note that when references are not being produced,
that is, neither option `-A` nor option `-r` is selected, the last
parameter of each `\xx` call is inhibited. Option `-M` can be used to
change ‘`xx`’ to another macro name.

In this output format, some special characters, like ‘`$`’, ‘`%`’,
‘`&`’, ‘`#`’ and ‘`_`’ are automatically protected with a backslash.
Curly brackets ‘`{`’, ‘`}`’ are protected with a backslash and a pair of
dollar signs (to force mathematical mode). The backslash itself produces
the sequence `\backslash{}`. Circumflex and tilde diacritical marks
produce the sequence `^\{ }` and `~\{ }` respectively. Other
diacriticized characters of the underlying character set produce an
appropriate TeX sequence as far as possible. The other non-graphical
characters, like newline and tab, and all other characters which are not
part of ASCII, are merely changed to exactly one space, with no special
attempt to compress consecutive spaces. Let me know how to improve this
special character processing for TeX.

<span id="The-GNU-extensions-to-ptx"></span>

#### 7.5.5 The GNU extensions to `ptx`

This version of `ptx` contains a few features which do not exist in
System V `ptx`. These extra features are suppressed by using the `-G`
command line option, unless overridden by other command line options.
Some GNU extensions cannot be recovered by overriding, so the simple
rule is to avoid `-G` if you care about GNU extensions. Here are the
differences between this program and System V `ptx`.

-   This program can read many input files at once, it always writes the
    resulting concordance on standard output. On the other hand, System
    V `ptx` reads only one file and sends the result to standard output
    or, if a second `file` parameter is given on the command, to that
    `file`.

    Having output parameters not introduced by options is a dangerous
    practice which GNU avoids as far as possible. So, for using `ptx`
    portably between GNU and System V, you should always use it with a
    single input file, and always expect the result on standard output.
    You might also want to automatically configure in a `-G` option to
    `ptx` calls in products using `ptx`, if the configurator finds that
    the installed `ptx` accepts `-G`.

-   The only options available in System V `ptx` are options `-b`, `-f`,
    `-g`, `-i`, `-o`, `-r`, `-t` and `-w`. All other options are GNU
    extensions and are not repeated in this enumeration. Moreover, some
    options have a slightly different meaning when GNU extensions are
    enabled, as explained below.

-   By default, concordance output is not formatted for `troff` or
    `nroff`. It is rather formatted for a dumb terminal. `troff` or
    `nroff` output may still be selected through option `-O`.

-   Unless `-R` option is used, the maximum reference width is
    subtracted from the total output line width. With GNU extensions
    disabled, width of references is not taken into account in the
    output line width computations.

-   All 256 bytes, even ASCII NUL bytes, are always read and processed
    from input file with no adverse effect, even if GNU extensions are
    disabled. However, System V `ptx` does not accept 8-bit characters,
    a few control characters are rejected, and the tilde ‘`~`’ is also
    rejected.

-   Input line length is only limited by available memory, even if GNU
    extensions are disabled. However, System V `ptx` processes only the
    first 200 characters in each line.

-   The break (non-word) characters default to be every character except
    all letters of the underlying character set, diacriticized or not.
    When GNU extensions are disabled, the break characters default to
    space, tab and newline only.

-   The program makes better use of output line width. If GNU extensions
    are disabled, the program rather tries to imitate System V `ptx`,
    but still, there are some slight disposition glitches this program
    does not completely reproduce.

-   The user can specify both an Ignore file and an Only file. This is
    not allowed with System V `ptx`.

### 7.6 `tsort`: Topological sort

<span id="index-tsort"></span> <span id="index-topological-sort"></span>

`tsort` performs a topological sort on the given `file`, or standard
input if no input file is given or for a `file` of ‘`-`’. For more
details and some history, see [tsort background](#tsort-background).
Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
tsort [option] [file]
```

</div>

`tsort` reads its input as pairs of strings, separated by blanks,
indicating a partial ordering. The output is a total ordering that
corresponds to the given partial ordering.

For example

<div class="example">

``` example
tsort <<EOF
a b c
d
e f
b c d e
EOF
```

</div>

will produce the output

<div class="example">

``` example
a
b
c
d
e
f
```

</div>

Consider a more realistic example. You have a large set of functions all
in one file, and they may all be declared static except one. Currently
that one (say `main`) is the first function defined in the file, and the
ones it calls directly follow it, followed by those they call, etc.
Let’s say that you are determined to take advantage of prototypes, so
you have to choose between declaring all of those functions (which means
duplicating a lot of information from the definitions) and rearranging
the functions so that as many as possible are defined before they are
used. One way to automate the latter process is to get a list for each
function of the functions it calls directly. Many programs can generate
such lists. They describe a call graph. Consider the following list, in
which a given line indicates that the function on the left calls the one
on the right directly.

<div class="example">

``` example
main parse_options
main tail_file
main tail_forever
tail_file pretty_name
tail_file write_header
tail_file tail
tail_forever recheck
tail_forever pretty_name
tail_forever write_header
tail_forever dump_remainder
tail tail_lines
tail tail_bytes
tail_lines start_lines
tail_lines dump_remainder
tail_lines file_lines
tail_lines pipe_lines
tail_bytes xlseek
tail_bytes start_bytes
tail_bytes dump_remainder
tail_bytes pipe_bytes
file_lines dump_remainder
recheck pretty_name
```

</div>

then you can use `tsort` to produce an ordering of those functions that
satisfies your requirement.

<div class="example">

``` example
example$ tsort call-graph | tac
dump_remainder
start_lines
file_lines
pipe_lines
xlseek
start_bytes
pipe_bytes
tail_lines
tail_bytes
pretty_name
write_header
tail
recheck
parse_options
tail_file
tail_forever
main
```

</div>

`tsort` detects any cycles in the input and writes the first cycle
encountered to standard error.

Note that for a given partial ordering, generally there is no unique
total ordering. In the context of the call graph above, the function
`parse_options` may be placed anywhere in the list as long as it
precedes `main`.

The only options are `--help` and `--version`. See [Common
options](#Common-options).

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

<span id="tsort_003a-Background"></span>

#### 7.6.1 `tsort`: Background

`tsort` exists because very early versions of the Unix linker processed
an archive file exactly once, and in order. As `ld` read each object in
the archive, it decided whether it was needed in the program based on
whether it defined any symbols which were undefined at that point in the
link.

This meant that dependencies within the archive had to be handled
specially. For example, `scanf` probably calls `read`. That means that
in a single pass through an archive, it was important for `scanf.o` to
appear before read.o, because otherwise a program which calls `scanf`
but not `read` might end up with an unexpected unresolved reference to
`read`.

The way to address this problem was to first generate a set of
dependencies of one object file on another. This was done by a shell
script called `lorder`. The GNU tools don’t provide a version of lorder,
as far as I know, but you can still find it in BSD distributions.

Then you ran `tsort` over the `lorder` output, and you used the
resulting sort to define the order in which you added objects to the
archive.

This whole procedure has been obsolete since about 1980, because Unix
archives now contain a symbol table (traditionally built by `ranlib`,
now generally built by `ar` itself), and the Unix linker uses the symbol
table to effectively make multiple passes over an archive file.

Anyhow, that’s where tsort came from. To solve an old problem with the
way the linker handled archive files, which has since been solved in
different ways.

</div>

<span id="cut_003a-Print-selected-parts-of-lines"></span>

### 8.1 `cut`: Print selected parts of lines

<span id="index-cut"></span>

`cut` writes to standard output selected parts of each line of each
input file, or standard input if no files are given or for a file name
of ‘`-`’. Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
cut option… [file]…
```

</div>

In the table which follows, the `byte-list`, `character-list`, and
`field-list` are one or more numbers or ranges (two numbers separated by
a dash) separated by commas. Bytes, characters, and fields are numbered
starting at 1. Incomplete ranges may be given: `-m` means ‘`1-m`’;
‘`n-`’ means ‘`n`’ through end of line or last field. The list elements
can be repeated, can overlap, and can be specified in any order; but the
selected input is written in the same order that it is read, and is
written exactly once.

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`-b byte-list`’  
‘`--bytes=byte-list`’  
<span id="index-_002db-11"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dbytes-5"></span>

Select for printing only the bytes in positions listed in `byte-list`.
Tabs and backspaces are treated like any other character; they take up 1
byte. If an output delimiter is specified, (see the description of
`--output-delimiter`), then output that string between ranges of
selected bytes.

‘`-c character-list`’  
‘`--characters=character-list`’  
<span id="index-_002dc-10"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dcharacters"></span>

Select for printing only the characters in positions listed in
`character-list`. The same as `-b` for now, but internationalization
will change that. Tabs and backspaces are treated like any other
character; they take up 1 character. If an output delimiter is
specified, (see the description of `--output-delimiter`), then output
that string between ranges of selected bytes.

‘`-f field-list`’  
‘`--fields=field-list`’  
<span id="index-_002df-8"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dfields"></span>

Select for printing only the fields listed in `field-list`. Fields are
separated by a TAB character by default. Also print any line that
contains no delimiter character, unless the `--only-delimited` (`-s`)
option is specified.

Note `awk` supports more sophisticated field processing, like reordering
fields, and handling fields aligned with blank characters. By default
`awk` uses (and discards) runs of blank characters to separate fields,
and ignores leading and trailing blanks.

<div class="example">

``` verbatim
awk '{print $2}'      # print the second field
awk '{print $(NF-1)}' # print the penultimate field
awk '{print $2,$1}'   # reorder the first two fields
```

</div>

Note while `cut` accepts field specifications in arbitrary order, output
is always in the order encountered in the file.

In the unlikely event that `awk` is unavailable, one can use the `join`
command, to process blank characters as `awk` does above.

<div class="example">

``` verbatim
join -a1 -o 1.2     - /dev/null # print the second field
join -a1 -o 1.2,1.1 - /dev/null # reorder the first two fields
```

</div>

‘`-d input_delim_byte`’  
‘`--delimiter=input_delim_byte`’  
<span id="index-_002dd-7"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002ddelimiter"></span>

With `-f`, use the first byte of `input_delim_byte` as the input fields
separator (default is TAB).

‘`-n`’  
<span id="index-_002dn-9"></span>

Do not split multi-byte characters (no-op for now).

‘`-s`’  
‘`--only-delimited`’  
<span id="index-_002ds-12"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002donly_002ddelimited"></span>

For `-f`, do not print lines that do not contain the field separator
character. Normally, any line without a field separator is printed
verbatim.

‘`--output-delimiter=output_delim_string`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002doutput_002ddelimiter"></span>

With `-f`, output fields are separated by `output_delim_string`. The
default with `-f` is to use the input delimiter. When using `-b` or `-c`
to select ranges of byte or character offsets (as opposed to ranges of
fields), output `output_delim_string` between non-overlapping ranges of
selected bytes.

‘`--complement`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dcomplement"></span>

This option is a GNU extension. Select for printing the complement of
the bytes, characters or fields selected with the `-b`, `-c` or `-f`
options. In other words, do *not* print the bytes, characters or fields
specified via those options. This option is useful when you have many
fields and want to print all but a few of them.

‘`-z`’  
‘`--zero-terminated`’  
<span id="index-_002dz-8"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dzero_002dterminated-6"></span> <span
id="index-process-zero_002dterminated-items-6"></span>

Delimit items with a zero byte rather than a newline (ASCII LF). I.e.,
treat input as items separated by ASCII NUL and terminate output items
with ASCII NUL. This option can be useful in conjunction with
‘`perl -0`’ or ‘`find -print0`’ and ‘`xargs -0`’ which do the same in
order to reliably handle arbitrary file names (even those containing
blanks or other special characters).

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

### 8.2 `paste`: Merge lines of files

<span id="index-paste"></span> <span id="index-merging-files"></span>

`paste` writes to standard output lines consisting of sequentially
corresponding lines of each given file, separated by a TAB character.
Standard input is used for a file name of ‘`-`’ or if no input files are
given.

Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
paste [option]… [file]…
```

</div>

For example, with:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ cat num2
1
2
$ cat let3
a
b
c
```

</div>

Take lines sequentially from each file:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ paste num2 let3
1       a
2       b
        c
```

</div>

Duplicate lines from a file:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ paste num2 let3 num2
1       a      1
2       b      2
        c
```

</div>

Intermix lines from standard input:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ paste - let3 - < num2
1       a      2
        b
        c
```

</div>

Join consecutive lines with a space:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ seq 4 | paste -d ' ' - -
1 2
3 4
```

</div>

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`-s`’  
‘`--serial`’  
<span id="index-_002ds-13"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dserial"></span>

Paste the lines of one file at a time rather than one line from each
file. Using the above example data:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ paste -s num2 let3
1       2
a       b       c
```

</div>

‘`-d delim-list`’  
‘`--delimiters=delim-list`’  
<span id="index-_002dd-8"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002ddelimiters"></span>

Consecutively use the characters in `delim-list` instead of TAB to
separate merged lines. When `delim-list` is exhausted, start again at
its beginning. Using the above example data:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ paste -d '%_' num2 let3 num2
1%a_1
2%b_2
%c_
```

</div>

‘`-z`’  
‘`--zero-terminated`’  
<span id="index-_002dz-9"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dzero_002dterminated-7"></span> <span
id="index-process-zero_002dterminated-items-7"></span>

Delimit items with a zero byte rather than a newline (ASCII LF). I.e.,
treat input as items separated by ASCII NUL and terminate output items
with ASCII NUL. This option can be useful in conjunction with
‘`perl -0`’ or ‘`find -print0`’ and ‘`xargs -0`’ which do the same in
order to reliably handle arbitrary file names (even those containing
blanks or other special characters).

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

### 8.3 `join`: Join lines on a common field

<span id="index-join"></span> <span
id="index-common-field_002c-joining-on"></span>

`join` writes to standard output a line for each pair of input lines
that have identical join fields. Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
join [option]… file1 file2
```

</div>

Either `file1` or `file2` (but not both) can be ‘`-`’, meaning standard
input. `file1` and `file2` should be sorted on the join fields.

<div class="example">

``` example
$ cat file1
a 1
b 2
e 5

$ cat file2
a X
e Y
f Z

$ join file1 file2
a 1 X
e 5 Y
```

</div>

`join`’s default behavior (when no options are given):

-   the join field is the first field in each line;
-   fields in the input are separated by one or more blanks, with
    leading blanks on the line ignored;
-   fields in the output are separated by a space;
-   each output line consists of the join field, the remaining fields
    from `file1`, then the remaining fields from `file2`.

<span id="General-options-1"></span>

#### 8.3.1 General options

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`-a file-number`’  
<span id="index-_002da-4"></span>

Print a line for each unpairable line in file `file-number` (either
‘`1`’ or ‘`2`’), in addition to the normal output.

‘`--check-order`’  
Fail with an error message if either input file is wrongly ordered.

‘`--nocheck-order`’  
Do not check that both input files are in sorted order. This is the
default.

‘`-e string`’  
<span id="index-_002de-3"></span>

Replace those output fields that are missing in the input with `string`.
I.e., missing fields specified with the `-12jo` options.

‘`--header`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dheader-1"></span>

Treat the first line of each input file as a header line. The header
lines will be joined and printed as the first output line. If `-o` is
used to specify output format, the header line will be printed according
to the specified format. The header lines will not be checked for
ordering even if `--check-order` is specified. Also if the header lines
from each file do not match, the heading fields from the first file will
be used.

‘`-i`’  
‘`--ignore-case`’  
<span id="index-_002di-8"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dignore_002dcase-3"></span>

Ignore differences in case when comparing keys. With this option, the
lines of the input files must be ordered in the same way. Use
‘`sort -f`’ to produce this ordering.

‘`-1 field`’  
<span id="index-_002d1-1"></span>

Join on field `field` (a positive integer) of file 1.

‘`-2 field`’  
<span id="index-_002d2-1"></span>

Join on field `field` (a positive integer) of file 2.

‘`-j field`’  
Equivalent to `-1 field -2 field`.

‘`-o field-list`’  
‘`-o auto`’  
If the keyword ‘`auto`’ is specified, infer the output format from the
first line in each file. This is the same as the default output format
but also ensures the same number of fields are output for each line.
Missing fields are replaced with the `-e` option and extra fields are
discarded.

Otherwise, construct each output line according to the format in
`field-list`. Each element in `field-list` is either the single
character ‘`0`’ or has the form `m.n` where the file number, `m`, is
‘`1`’ or ‘`2`’ and `n` is a positive field number.

A field specification of ‘`0`’ denotes the join field. In most cases,
the functionality of the ‘`0`’ field spec may be reproduced using the
explicit `m.n` that corresponds to the join field. However, when
printing unpairable lines (using either of the `-a` or `-v` options),
there is no way to specify the join field using `m.n` in `field-list` if
there are unpairable lines in both files. To give `join` that
functionality, POSIX invented the ‘`0`’ field specification notation.

The elements in `field-list` are separated by commas or blanks. Blank
separators typically need to be quoted for the shell. For example, the
commands ‘`join -o 1.2,2.2`’ and ‘`join -o '1.2 2.2'`’ are equivalent.

All output lines—including those printed because of any -a or -v
option—are subject to the specified `field-list`.

‘`-t char`’  
Use character `char` as the input and output field separator. Treat as
significant each occurrence of `char` in the input file. Use
‘`sort -t char`’, without the `-b` option of ‘`sort`’, to produce this
ordering. If ‘`join -t ''`’ is specified, the whole line is considered,
matching the default operation of sort. If ‘`-t '\0'`’ is specified then
the ASCII NUL character is used to delimit the fields.

‘`-v file-number`’  
Print a line for each unpairable line in file `file-number` (either
‘`1`’ or ‘`2`’), instead of the normal output.

‘`-z`’  
‘`--zero-terminated`’  
<span id="index-_002dz-10"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dzero_002dterminated-8"></span> <span
id="index-process-zero_002dterminated-items-8"></span>

Delimit items with a zero byte rather than a newline (ASCII LF). I.e.,
treat input as items separated by ASCII NUL and terminate output items
with ASCII NUL. This option can be useful in conjunction with
‘`perl -0`’ or ‘`find -print0`’ and ‘`xargs -0`’ which do the same in
order to reliably handle arbitrary file names (even those containing
blanks or other special characters). Note with `-z` the newline
character is treated as a field separator.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

If the `--check-order` option is given, unsorted inputs will cause a
fatal error message. If the option `--nocheck-order` is given, unsorted
inputs will never cause an error message. If neither of these options is
given, wrongly sorted inputs are diagnosed only if an input file is
found to contain unpairable lines, and when both input files are non
empty. If an input file is diagnosed as being unsorted, the `join`
command will exit with a nonzero status (and the output should not be
used).

Forcing `join` to process wrongly sorted input files containing
unpairable lines by specifying `--nocheck-order` is not guaranteed to
produce any particular output. The output will probably not correspond
with whatever you hoped it would be.

<span id="Pre_002dsorting"></span>

#### 8.3.2 Pre-sorting

`join` requires sorted input files. Each input file should be sorted
according to the key (=field/column number) used in `join`. The
recommended sorting option is ‘`sort -k 1b,1`’ (assuming the desired key
is in the first column).

Typical usage:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ sort -k 1b,1 file1 > file1.sorted
$ sort -k 1b,1 file2 > file2.sorted
$ join file1.sorted file2.sorted > file3
```

</div>

<span id="index-LC_005fCOLLATE-3"></span>

Normally, the sort order is that of the collating sequence specified by
the `LC_COLLATE` locale. Unless the `-t` option is given, the sort
comparison ignores blanks at the start of the join field, as in
`sort -b`. If the `--ignore-case` option is given, the sort comparison
ignores the case of characters in the join field, as in `sort -f`:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ sort -k 1bf,1 file1 > file1.sorted
$ sort -k 1bf,1 file2 > file2.sorted
$ join --ignore-case file1.sorted file2.sorted > file3
```

</div>

The `sort` and `join` commands should use consistent locales and options
if the output of `sort` is fed to `join`. You can use a command like
‘`sort -k 1b,1`’ to sort a file on its default join field, but if you
select a non-default locale, join field, separator, or comparison
options, then you should do so consistently between `join` and `sort`.

To avoid any locale-related issues, it is recommended to use the ‘`C`’
locale for both commands:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ LC_ALL=C sort -k 1b,1 file1 > file1.sorted
$ LC_ALL=C sort -k 1b,1 file2 > file2.sorted
$ LC_ALL=C join file1.sorted file2.sorted > file3
```

</div>

</div>

<span id="Working-with-fields-1"></span>

#### 8.3.3 Working with fields

Use `-1`,`-2` to set the key fields for each of the input files. Ensure
the preceding `sort` commands operated on the same fields.

The following example joins two files, using the values from seventh
field of the first file and the third field of the second file:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ sort -k 7b,7 file1 > file1.sorted
$ sort -k 3b,3 file2 > file2.sorted
$ join -1 7 -2 3 file1.sorted file2.sorted > file3
```

</div>

If the field number is the same for both files, use `-j`:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ sort -k4b,4 file1 > file1.sorted
$ sort -k4b,4 file2 > file2.sorted
$ join -j4    file1.sorted file2.sorted > file3
```

</div>

Both `sort` and `join` operate of whitespace-delimited fields. To
specify a different delimiter, use `-t` in *both*:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ sort -t, -k3b,3 file1 > file1.sorted
$ sort -t, -k3b,3 file2 > file2.sorted
$ join -t, -j3    file1.sorted file2.sorted > file3
```

</div>

To specify a tab (<span class="small">ASCII</span> 0x09) character
instead of whitespace, use <a href="#FOOT3" id="DOCF3"><sup>3</sup></a>:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ sort -t$'\t' -k3b,3 file1 > file1.sorted
$ sort -t$'\t' -k3b,3 file2 > file2.sorted
$ join -t$'\t' -j3    file1.sorted file2.sorted > file3
```

</div>

If ‘`join -t ''`’ is specified then the whole line is considered which
matches the default operation of sort:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ sort file1 > file1.sorted
$ sort file2 > file2.sorted
$ join -t '' file1.sorted file2.sorted > file3
```

</div>

<span id="Controlling-join_0027s-field-matching"></span>

#### 8.3.4 Controlling `join`’s field matching

In this section the `sort` commands are omitted for brevity. Sorting the
files before joining is still required.

`join`’s default behavior is to print only lines common to both input
files. Use `-a` and `-v` to print unpairable lines from one or both
files.

All examples below use the following two (pre-sorted) input files:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td width="50%"><div class="example">
<pre class="example"><code>$ cat file1
a 1
b 2</code></pre>
</div></td>
<td width="50%"><div class="example">
<pre class="example"><code>$ cat file2
a A
c C</code></pre>
</div></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th width="50%">Command</th>
<th width="50%">Outcome</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td width="50%"><div class="example">
<pre class="example"><code>$ join file1 file2
a 1 A</code></pre>
</div></td>
<td width="50%">common lines (<em>intersection</em>)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td width="50%"><div class="example">
<pre class="example"><code>$ join -a 1 file1 file2
a 1 A
b 2</code></pre>
</div></td>
<td width="50%">common lines <em>and</em> unpaired lines from the first
file</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td width="50%"><div class="example">
<pre class="example"><code>$ join -a 2 file1 file2
a 1 A
c C</code></pre>
</div></td>
<td width="50%">common lines <em>and</em> unpaired lines from the second
file</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td width="50%"><div class="example">
<pre class="example"><code>$ join -a 1 -a 2 file1 file2
a 1 A
b 2
c C</code></pre>
</div></td>
<td width="50%">all lines (paired and unpaired) from both files
(<em>union</em>).<br />
see note below regarding <code>-o auto</code>.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td width="50%"><div class="example">
<pre class="example"><code>$ join -v 1 file1 file2
b 2</code></pre>
</div></td>
<td width="50%">unpaired lines from the first file
(<em>difference</em>)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td width="50%"><div class="example">
<pre class="example"><code>$ join -v 2 file1 file2
c C</code></pre>
</div></td>
<td width="50%">unpaired lines from the second file
(<em>difference</em>)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td width="50%"><div class="example">
<pre class="example"><code>$ join -v 1 -v 2 file1 file2
b 2
c C</code></pre>
</div></td>
<td width="50%">unpaired lines from both files, omitting common lines
(<em>symmetric difference</em>).</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The `-o auto -e X` options are useful when dealing with unpaired lines.
The following example prints all lines (common and unpaired) from both
files. Without `-o auto` it is not easy to discern which fields
originate from which file:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ join -a 1 -a 2 file1 file2
a 1 A
b 2
c C

$ join -o auto -e X -a 1 -a 2 file1 file2
a 1 A
b 2 X
c X C
```

</div>

If the input has no unpairable lines, a GNU extension is available; the
sort order can be any order that considers two fields to be equal if and
only if the sort comparison described above considers them to be equal.
For example:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ cat file1
a a1
c c1
b b1

$ cat file2
a a2
c c2
b b2

$ join file1 file2
a a1 a2
c c1 c2
b b1 b2
```

</div>

</div>

<span id="Header-lines-1"></span>

#### 8.3.5 Header lines

The `--header` option can be used when the files to join have a header
line which is not sorted:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ cat file1
Name     Age
Alice    25
Charlie  34

$ cat file2
Name   Country
Alice  France
Bob    Spain

$ join --header -o auto -e NA -a1 -a2 file1 file2
Name     Age   Country
Alice    25    France
Bob      NA    Spain
Charlie  34    NA
```

</div>

To sort a file with a header line, use GNU `sed -u`. The following
example sort the files but keeps the first line of each file in place:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ ( sed -u 1q ; sort -k2b,2 ) < file1 > file1.sorted
$ ( sed -u 1q ; sort -k2b,2 ) < file2 > file2.sorted
$ join --header -o auto -e NA -a1 -a2 file1.sorted file2.sorted > file3
```

</div>

</div>

<span id="Union_002c-Intersection-and-Difference-of-files"></span>

#### 8.3.6 Union, Intersection and Difference of files

Combine `sort`, `uniq` and `join` to perform the equivalent of set
operations on files:

| Command                            | outcome                                |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `sort -u file1 file2`              | Union of unsorted files                |
| `sort file1 file2 | uniq -d`       | Intersection of unsorted files         |
| `sort file1 file1 file2 | uniq -u` | Difference of unsorted files           |
| `sort file1 file2 | uniq -u`       | Symmetric Difference of unsorted files |
| `join -t '' -a1 -a2 file1 file2`   | Union of sorted files                  |
| `join -t '' file1 file2`           | Intersection of sorted files           |
| `join -t '' -v2 file1 file2`       | Difference of sorted files             |
| `join -t '' -v1 -v2 file1 file2`   | Symmetric Difference of sorted files   |

All examples above operate on entire lines and not on specific fields:
`sort` without `-k` and `join -t ''` both consider entire lines as the
key.

### 9.1 `tr`: Translate, squeeze, and/or delete characters

<span id="index-tr"></span>

Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
tr [option]… string1 [string2]
```

</div>

`tr` copies standard input to standard output, performing one of the
following operations:

-   translate, and optionally squeeze repeated characters in the result,
-   squeeze repeated characters,
-   delete characters,
-   delete characters, then squeeze repeated characters from the result.

The `string1` and `string2` operands define arrays of characters
`array1` and `array2`. By default `array1` lists input characters that
`tr` operates on, and `array2` lists corresponding translations. In some
cases the second operand is omitted.

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options). Options must precede operands.

‘`-c`’  
‘`-C`’  
‘`--complement`’  
<span id="index-_002dc-11"></span> <span id="index-_002dC-1"></span>
<span id="index-_002d_002dcomplement-1"></span>

Instead of `array1`, use its complement (all characters not specified by
`string1`), in ascending order. Use this option with caution in
multibyte locales where its meaning is not always clear or portable; see
[Character arrays](#Character-arrays).

‘`-d`’  
‘`--delete`’  
<span id="index-_002dd-9"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002ddelete"></span>

Delete characters in `array1`; do not translate.

‘`-s`’  
‘`--squeeze-repeats`’  
<span id="index-_002ds-14"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dsqueeze_002drepeats"></span>

Replace each sequence of a repeated character that is listed in the last
specified `array`, with a single occurrence of that character.

‘`-t`’  
‘`--truncate-set1`’  
<span id="index-_002dt-7"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dtruncate_002dset1"></span>

Truncate `array1` to the length of `array2`.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

<span id="Specifying-arrays-of-characters"></span>

#### 9.1.1 Specifying arrays of characters

<span id="index-arrays-of-characters-in-tr"></span>

The `string1` and `string2` operands are not regular expressions, even
though they may look similar. Instead, they merely represent arrays of
characters. As a GNU extension to POSIX, an empty string operand
represents an empty array of characters.

The interpretation of `string1` and `string2` depends on locale. GNU
`tr` fully supports only safe single-byte locales, where each possible
input byte represents a single character. Unfortunately, this means GNU
`tr` will not handle commands like ‘`tr $'\u7530' $'\u68EE'`’ the way
you might expect, since (assuming a UTF-8 encoding) this is equivalent
to ‘`tr '\347\224\260' '\346\243\256'`’ and GNU `tr` will simply
transliterate all ‘`\347`’ bytes to ‘`\346`’ bytes, etc. POSIX does not
clearly specify the behavior of `tr` in locales where characters are
represented by byte sequences instead of by individual bytes, or where
data might contain invalid bytes that are encoding errors. To avoid
problems in this area, you can run `tr` in a safe single-byte locale by
using a shell command like ‘`LC_ALL=C tr`’ instead of plain `tr`.

Although most characters simply represent themselves in `string1` and
`string2`, the strings can contain shorthands listed below, for
convenience. Some shorthands can be used only in `string1` or `string2`,
as noted below.

Backslash escapes  
<span id="index-backslash-escapes"></span>

The following backslash escape sequences are recognized:

‘`\a`’  
Bell (BEL, Control-G).

‘`\b`’  
Backspace (BS, Control-H).

‘`\f`’  
Form feed (FF, Control-L).

‘`\n`’  
Newline (LF, Control-J).

‘`\r`’  
Carriage return (CR, Control-M).

‘`\t`’  
Tab (HT, Control-I).

‘`\v`’  
Vertical tab (VT, Control-K).

‘`\ooo`’  
The eight-bit byte with the value given by `ooo`, which is the longest
sequence of one to three octal digits following the backslash. For
portability, `ooo` should represent a value that fits in eight bits. As
a GNU extension to POSIX, if the value would not fit, then only the
first two digits of `ooo` are used, e.g., ‘`\400`’ is equivalent to
‘`\0400`’ and represents a two-byte sequence.

‘`\\`’  
A backslash.

It is an error if no character follows an unescaped backslash. As a GNU
extension, a backslash followed by a character not listed above is
interpreted as that character, removing any special significance; this
can be used to escape the characters ‘`[`’ and ‘`-`’ when they would
otherwise be special.

Ranges  
<span id="index-ranges"></span>

The notation ‘`m-n`’ expands to the characters from `m` through `n`, in
ascending order. `m` should not collate after `n`; if it does, an error
results. As an example, ‘`0-9`’ is the same as ‘`0123456789`’.

GNU `tr` does not support the System V syntax that uses square brackets
to enclose ranges. Translations specified in that format sometimes work
as expected, since the brackets are often transliterated to themselves.
However, they should be avoided because they sometimes behave
unexpectedly. For example, ‘`tr -d '[0-9]'`’ deletes brackets as well as
digits.

Many historically common and even accepted uses of ranges are not fully
portable. For example, on EBCDIC hosts using the ‘`A-Z`’ range will not
do what most would expect because ‘`A`’ through ‘`Z`’ are not contiguous
as they are in ASCII. One way to work around this is to use character
classes (see below). Otherwise, it is most portable (and most ugly) to
enumerate the members of the ranges.

Repeated characters  
<span id="index-repeated-characters"></span>

The notation ‘`[c*n]`’ in `string2` expands to `n` copies of character
`c`. Thus, ‘`[y*6]`’ is the same as ‘`yyyyyy`’. The notation ‘`[c*]`’ in
`string2` expands to as many copies of `c` as are needed to make
`array2` as long as `array1`. If `n` begins with ‘`0`’, it is
interpreted in octal, otherwise in decimal. A zero-valued `n` is treated
as if it were absent.

Character classes  
<span id="index-character-classes"></span>

The notation ‘`[:class:]`’ expands to all characters in the (predefined)
class `class`. When the `--delete` (`-d`) and `--squeeze-repeats` (`-s`)
options are both given, any character class can be used in `string2`.
Otherwise, only the character classes `lower` and `upper` are accepted
in `string2`, and then only if the corresponding character class
(`upper` and `lower`, respectively) is specified in the same relative
position in `string1`. Doing this specifies case conversion. Except for
case conversion, a class’s characters appear in no particular order. The
class names are given below; an error results when an invalid class name
is given.

`alnum`  
<span id="index-alnum"></span>

Letters and digits.

`alpha`  
<span id="index-alpha"></span>

Letters.

`blank`  
<span id="index-blank"></span>

Horizontal whitespace.

`cntrl`  
<span id="index-cntrl"></span>

Control characters.

`digit`  
<span id="index-digit"></span>

Digits.

`graph`  
<span id="index-graph"></span>

Printable characters, not including space.

`lower`  
<span id="index-lower"></span>

Lowercase letters.

`print`  
<span id="index-print"></span>

Printable characters, including space.

`punct`  
<span id="index-punct"></span>

Punctuation characters.

`space`  
<span id="index-space"></span>

Horizontal or vertical whitespace.

`upper`  
<span id="index-upper"></span>

Uppercase letters.

`xdigit`  
<span id="index-xdigit"></span>

Hexadecimal digits.

Equivalence classes  
<span id="index-equivalence-classes"></span>

The syntax ‘`[=c=]`’ expands to all characters equivalent to `c`, in no
particular order. These equivalence classes are allowed in `string2`
only when `--delete` (`-d`) and `--squeeze-repeats` `-s` are both given.

Although equivalence classes are intended to support non-English
alphabets, there seems to be no standard way to define them or determine
their contents. Therefore, they are not fully implemented in GNU `tr`;
each character’s equivalence class consists only of that character,
which is of no particular use.

#### 9.1.2 Translating

<span id="index-translating-characters"></span>

`tr` performs translation when `string1` and `string2` are both given
and the `--delete` (`-d`) option is not given. `tr` translates each
character of its input that is in `array1` to the corresponding
character in `array2`. Characters not in `array1` are passed through
unchanged.

As a GNU extension to POSIX, when a character appears more than once in
`array1`, only the final instance is used. For example, these two
commands are equivalent:

<div class="example">

``` example
tr aaa xyz
tr a z
```

</div>

A common use of `tr` is to convert lowercase characters to uppercase.
This can be done in many ways. Here are three of them:

<div class="example">

``` example
tr abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
tr a-z A-Z
tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]'
```

</div>

However, ranges like `a-z` are not portable outside the C locale.

When `tr` is performing translation, `array1` and `array2` typically
have the same length. If `array1` is shorter than `array2`, the extra
characters at the end of `array2` are ignored.

On the other hand, making `array1` longer than `array2` is not portable;
POSIX says that the result is undefined. In this situation, BSD `tr`
pads `array2` to the length of `array1` by repeating the last character
of `array2` as many times as necessary. System V `tr` truncates `array1`
to the length of `array2`.

By default, GNU `tr` handles this case like BSD `tr`. When the
`--truncate-set1` (`-t`) option is given, GNU `tr` handles this case
like the System V `tr` instead. This option is ignored for operations
other than translation.

Acting like System V `tr` in this case breaks the relatively common BSD
idiom:

<div class="example">

``` example
tr -cs A-Za-z0-9 '\012'
```

</div>

because it converts only zero bytes (the first element in the complement
of `array1`), rather than all non-alphanumerics, to newlines.

By the way, the above idiom is not portable because it uses ranges, and
it assumes that the octal code for newline is 012. Here is a better way
to write it:

<div class="example">

``` example
tr -cs '[:alnum:]' '[\n*]'
```

</div>

#### 9.1.3 Squeezing repeats and deleting

<span id="index-squeezing-repeat-characters"></span> <span
id="index-deleting-characters"></span> <span
id="index-removing-characters"></span>

When given just the `--delete` (`-d`) option, `tr` removes any input
characters that are in `array1`.

When given just the `--squeeze-repeats` (`-s`) option and not
translating, `tr` replaces each input sequence of a repeated character
that is in `array1` with a single occurrence of that character.

When given both `--delete` and `--squeeze-repeats`, `tr` first performs
any deletions using `array1`, then squeezes repeats from any remaining
characters using `array2`.

The `--squeeze-repeats` option may also be used when translating, in
which case `tr` first performs translation, then squeezes repeats from
any remaining characters using `array2`.

Here are some examples to illustrate various combinations of options:

-   Remove all zero bytes:
    <div class="example">

    ``` example
    tr -d '\0'
    ```

    </div>

-   Put all words on lines by themselves. This converts all
    non-alphanumeric characters to newlines, then squeezes each string
    of repeated newlines into a single newline:
    <div class="example">

    ``` example
    tr -cs '[:alnum:]' '[\n*]'
    ```

    </div>

-   Convert each sequence of repeated newlines to a single newline.
    I.e., delete empty lines:
    <div class="example">

    ``` example
    tr -s '\n'
    ```

    </div>

-   Find doubled occurrences of words in a document. For example, people
    often write “the the” with the repeated words separated by a
    newline. The Bourne shell script below works first by converting
    each sequence of punctuation and blank characters to a single
    newline. That puts each “word” on a line by itself. Next it maps all
    uppercase characters to lower case, and finally it runs `uniq` with
    the `-d` option to print out only the words that were repeated.
    <div class="example">

    ``` example
    #!/bin/sh
    cat -- "$@" \
      | tr -s '[:punct:][:blank:]' '[\n*]' \
      | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' \
      | uniq -d
    ```

    </div>

-   Deleting a small set of characters is usually straightforward. For
    example, to remove all ‘`a`’s, ‘`x`’s, and ‘`M`’s you would do this:

    <div class="example">

    ``` example
    tr -d axM
    ```

    </div>

    However, when ‘`-`’ is one of those characters, it can be tricky
    because ‘`-`’ has special meanings. Performing the same task as
    above but also removing all ‘`-`’ characters, we might try
    `tr -d -axM`, but that would fail because `tr` would try to
    interpret `-a` as a command-line option. Alternatively, we could try
    putting the hyphen inside the string, `tr -d a-xM`, but that
    wouldn’t work either because it would make `tr` interpret `a-x` as
    the range of characters ‘`a`’…‘`x`’ rather than the three. One way
    to solve the problem is to put the hyphen at the end of the list of
    characters:

    <div class="example">

    ``` example
    tr -d axM-
    ```

    </div>

    Or you can use ‘`--`’ to terminate option processing:

    <div class="example">

    ``` example
    tr -d -- -axM
    ```

    </div>

### 9.2 `expand`: Convert tabs to spaces

<span id="index-expand"></span> <span
id="index-tabs-to-spaces_002c-converting"></span> <span
id="index-converting-tabs-to-spaces"></span>

`expand` writes the contents of each given `file`, or standard input if
none are given or for a `file` of ‘`-`’, to standard output, with tab
characters converted to the appropriate number of spaces. Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
expand [option]… [file]…
```

</div>

By default, `expand` converts all tabs to spaces. It preserves backspace
characters in the output; they decrement the column count for tab
calculations. The default action is equivalent to `-t 8` (set tabs every
8 columns).

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`-t tab1[,tab2]…`’  
‘`--tabs=tab1[,tab2]…`’  
<span id="index-_002dt-8"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dtabs"></span> <span
id="index-tab-stops_002c-setting"></span>

If only one tab stop is given, set the tabs `tab1` spaces apart (default
is 8). Otherwise, set the tabs at columns `tab1`, `tab2`, … (numbered
from 0), and replace any tabs beyond the last tab stop given with single
spaces. Tab stops can be separated by blanks as well as by commas.

As a GNU extension the last `tab` specified can be prefixed with a ‘`/`’
to indicate a tab size to use for remaining positions. For example,
`--tabs=2,4,/8` will set tab stops at position 2 and 4, and every
multiple of 8 after that.

Also the last `tab` specified can be prefixed with a ‘`+`’ to indicate a
tab size to use for remaining positions, offset from the final
explicitly specified tab stop. For example, to ignore the 1 character
gutter present in diff output, one can specify a 1 character offset
using `--tabs=1,+8`, which will set tab stops at positions 1,9,17,…

For compatibility, GNU `expand` also accepts the obsolete option syntax,
`-t1[,t2]…`. New scripts should use `-t t1[,t2]…` instead.

<span id="index-_002di-9"></span> <span

Only convert initial tabs (those that precede all non-space or non-tab
characters) on each line to spaces.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

<span id="unexpand_003a-Convert-spaces-to-tabs"></span>

### 9.3 `unexpand`: Convert spaces to tabs

<span id="index-unexpand"></span>

`unexpand` writes the contents of each given `file`, or standard input
if none are given or for a `file` of ‘`-`’, to standard output,
converting blanks at the beginning of each line into as many tab
characters as needed. In the default POSIX locale, a *blank* is a space
or a tab; other locales may specify additional blank characters.
Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
unexpand [option]… [file]…
```

</div>

By default, `unexpand` converts only initial blanks (those that precede
all non-blank characters) on each line. It preserves backspace
characters in the output; they decrement the column count for tab
calculations. By default, tabs are set at every 8th column.

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`-t tab1[,tab2]…`’  
‘`--tabs=tab1[,tab2]…`’  
<span id="index-_002dt-9"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dtabs-1"></span>

If only one tab stop is given, set the tabs `tab1` columns apart instead
of the default 8. Otherwise, set the tabs at columns `tab1`, `tab2`, …
(numbered from 0), and leave blanks beyond the tab stops given
unchanged. Tab stops can be separated by blanks as well as by commas.

As a GNU extension the last `tab` specified can be prefixed with a ‘`/`’
to indicate a tab size to use for remaining positions. For example,
`--tabs=2,4,/8` will set tab stops at position 2 and 4, and every
multiple of 8 after that.

Also the last `tab` specified can be prefixed with a ‘`+`’ to indicate a
tab size to use for remaining positions, offset from the final
explicitly specified tab stop. For example, to ignore the 1 character
gutter present in diff output, one can specify a 1 character offset
using `--tabs=1,+8`, which will set tab stops at positions 1,9,17,…

This option implies the `-a` option.

For compatibility, GNU `unexpand` supports the obsolete option syntax,
`-tab1[,tab2]…`, where tab stops must be separated by commas. (Unlike
`-t`, this obsolete option does not imply `-a`.) New scripts should use
`--first-only -t tab1[,tab2]…` instead.

‘`-a`’  
‘`--all`’  
<span id="index-_002da-5"></span> <span id="index-_002d_002dall"></span>

Also convert all sequences of two or more blanks just before a tab stop,
even if they occur after non-blank characters in a line.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

### 10.1 `ls`: List directory contents

<span id="index-ls"></span> <span id="index-directory-listing"></span>

The `ls` program lists information about files (of any type, including
directories). Options and file arguments can be intermixed arbitrarily,
as usual. Later options override earlier options that are incompatible.

For non-option command-line arguments that are directories, by default
`ls` lists the contents of directories, not recursively, and omitting
files with names beginning with ‘`.`’. For other non-option arguments,
by default `ls` lists just the file name. If no non-option argument is
specified, `ls` operates on the current directory, acting as if it had
been invoked with a single argument of ‘`.`’.

<span id="index-LC_005fALL-1"></span>

By default, the output is sorted alphabetically, according to the locale
settings in effect.<a href="#FOOT4" id="DOCF4"><sup>4</sup></a> If
standard output is a terminal, the output is in columns (sorted
vertically) and control characters are output as question marks;
otherwise, the output is listed one per line and control characters are
output as-is.

Because `ls` is such a fundamental program, it has accumulated many
options over the years. They are described in the subsections below;
within each section, options are listed alphabetically (ignoring case).
The division of options into the subsections is not absolute, since some
options affect more than one aspect of `ls`’s operation.

<span id="index-exit-status-of-ls"></span>

Exit status:

1 minor problems  (e.g., failure to access a file or directory not

#### 10.1.1 Which files are listed

These options determine which files `ls` lists information for. By
default, `ls` lists files and the contents of any directories on the
command line, except that in directories it ignores files whose names
start with ‘`.`’.

‘`-a`’  
‘`--all`’  
<span id="index-_002da-6"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dall-1"></span>

In directories, do not ignore file names that start with ‘`.`’.

‘`-A`’  
‘`--almost-all`’  
<span id="index-_002dA-3"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dalmost_002dall"></span>

In directories, do not ignore all file names that start with ‘`.`’;
ignore only `.` and `..`. The `--all` (`-a`) option overrides this
option.

‘`-B`’  
‘`--ignore-backups`’  
<span id="index-_002dB"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dignore_002dbackups"></span> <span

equivalent to ‘`--ignore='*~' --ignore='.*~'`’.

‘`-d`’  
‘`--directory`’  
<span id="index-_002dd-10"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002ddirectory"></span>

List just the names of directories, as with other types of files, rather
than listing their contents. Do not follow symbolic links listed on the
command line unless the `--dereference-command-line` (`-H`),
`--dereference` (`-L`), or `--dereference-command-line-symlink-to-dir`
options are specified.

‘`-H`’  
‘`--dereference-command-line`’  
<span id="index-_002dH-1"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002ddereference_002dcommand_002dline"></span> <span
id="index-symbolic-links_002c-dereferencing"></span>

If a command line argument specifies a symbolic link, show information
for the file the link references rather than for the link itself.

‘`--dereference-command-line-symlink-to-dir`’  
<span
id="index-_002d_002ddereference_002dcommand_002dline_002dsymlink_002dto_002ddir"></span>
<span id="index-symbolic-links_002c-dereferencing-1"></span>

Do not dereference symbolic links, with one exception: if a command line
argument specifies a symbolic link that refers to a directory, show
information for that directory rather than for the link itself. This is
the default behavior unless long format is being used or any of the
following options is in effect: `--classify` (`-F`), `--directory`
(`-d`), `--dereference` (`-L`), or `--dereference-command-line` (`-H`)).

‘`--group-directories-first`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dgroup_002ddirectories_002dfirst"></span>

Group all the directories before the files and then sort the directories
and the files separately using the selected sort key (see –sort option).
That is, this option specifies a primary sort key, and the –sort option
specifies a secondary key. However, any use of `--sort=none` (`-U`)
disables this option altogether.

‘`--hide=PATTERN`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dhide_003dpattern"></span>

In directories, ignore files whose names match the shell pattern
`pattern`, unless the `--all` (`-a`) or `--almost-all` (`-A`) is also
given. This option acts like `--ignore=pattern` except that it has no
effect if `--all` (`-a`) or `--almost-all` (`-A`) is also given.

This option can be useful in shell aliases. For example, if `lx` is an
alias for ‘`ls --hide='*~'`’ and `ly` is an alias for
‘`ls --ignore='*~'`’, then the command ‘`lx -A`’ lists the file
`README~` even though ‘`ly -A`’ would not.

‘`-I pattern`’  
‘`--ignore=pattern`’  
<span id="index-_002dI"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dignore_003dpattern"></span>

In directories, ignore files whose names match the shell pattern (not
regular expression) `pattern`. As in the shell, an initial ‘`.`’ in a
file name does not match a wildcard at the start of `pattern`. Sometimes
it is useful to give this option several times. For example,

<div class="example">

``` example
$ ls --ignore='.??*' --ignore='.[^.]' --ignore='#*'
```

</div>

The first option ignores names of length 3 or more that start with
‘`.`’, the second ignores all two-character names that start with ‘`.`’
except ‘`..`’, and the third ignores names that start with ‘`#`’.

‘`-L`’  
‘`--dereference`’  
<span id="index-_002dL-2"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002ddereference"></span> <span
id="index-symbolic-links_002c-dereferencing-2"></span>

When showing file information for a symbolic link, show information for
the file the link references rather than the link itself. However, even
with this option, `ls` still prints the name of the link itself, not the
name of the file that the link points to.

‘`-R`’  
‘`--recursive`’  
<span id="index-_002dR-2"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002drecursive"></span> <span
id="index-recursive-directory-listing"></span> <span
id="index-directory-listing_002c-recursive"></span>

List the contents of all directories recursively.

</div>

<span id="What-information-is-listed-1"></span>

#### 10.1.2 What information is listed

These options affect the information that `ls` displays. By default,
only file names are shown.

‘`--author`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dauthor"></span> <span
id="index-hurd_002c-author_002c-printing"></span>

In long format, list each file’s author. In GNU/Hurd, file authors can
differ from their owners, but in other operating systems the two are the
same.

‘`-D`’  
‘`--dired`’  
<span id="index-_002dD-1"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002ddired"></span> <span
id="index-dired-Emacs-mode-support"></span>

Print an additional line after the main output:

<div class="example">

``` example
//DIRED// beg1 end1 beg2 end2 …
```

</div>

The `begn` and `endn` are unsigned integers that record the byte
position of the beginning and end of each file name in the output. This
makes it easy for Emacs to find the names, even when they contain
unusual characters such as space or newline, without fancy searching.

If directories are being listed recursively via `--recursive` (`-R`),
output a similar line with offsets for each subdirectory name:

<div class="example">

``` example
//SUBDIRED// beg1 end1 …
```

</div>

Finally, output a line of the form:

<div class="example">

``` example
//DIRED-OPTIONS// --quoting-style=word
```

</div>

where `word` is the quoting style (see [Formatting the file
names](#Formatting-the-file-names)).

Here is an actual example:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ mkdir -p a/sub/deeper a/sub2
$ touch a/f1 a/f2
$ touch a/sub/deeper/file
$ ls -gloRF --dired a
  a:
  total 8
  -rw-r--r-- 1    0 Jun 10 12:27 f1
  -rw-r--r-- 1    0 Jun 10 12:27 f2
  drwxr-xr-x 3 4096 Jun 10 12:27 sub/
  drwxr-xr-x 2 4096 Jun 10 12:27 sub2/

  a/sub:
  total 4
  drwxr-xr-x 2 4096 Jun 10 12:27 deeper/

  a/sub/deeper:
  total 0
  -rw-r--r-- 1 0 Jun 10 12:27 file

  a/sub2:
  total 0
//DIRED// 48 50 84 86 120 123 158 162 217 223 282 286
//SUBDIRED// 2 3 167 172 228 240 290 296
//DIRED-OPTIONS// --quoting-style=literal
```

</div>

The pairs of offsets on the ‘`//DIRED//`’ line above delimit these
names: `f1`, `f2`, `sub`, `sub2`, `deeper`, `file`. The offsets on the
‘`//SUBDIRED//`’ line delimit the following directory names: `a`,
`a/sub`, `a/sub/deeper`, `a/sub2`.

Here is an example of how to extract the fifth entry name, ‘`deeper`’,
corresponding to the pair of offsets, 222 and 228:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ ls -gloRF --dired a > out
$ dd bs=1 skip=222 count=6 < out 2>/dev/null; echo
deeper
```

</div>

Although the listing above includes a trailing slash for the ‘`deeper`’
entry, the offsets select the name without the trailing slash. However,
if you invoke `ls` with `--dired` (`-D`) along with an option like
`--escape` (`-b`) and operate on a file whose name contains special
characters, the backslash *is* included:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ touch 'a b'
$ ls -blog --dired 'a b'
  -rw-r--r-- 1 0 Jun 10 12:28 a\ b
//DIRED// 30 34
//DIRED-OPTIONS// --quoting-style=escape
```

</div>

If you use a quoting style like `--quoting-style=c` (`-Q`) that adds
quote marks, then the offsets include the quote marks. So beware that
the user may select the quoting style via the environment variable
`QUOTING_STYLE`. Hence, applications using `--dired` should either
specify an explicit `--quoting-style=literal` (`-N`) option on the
command line, or else be prepared to parse the escaped names.

The `--dired` (`-D`) option has well-defined behavior only when long
format is in effect and hyperlinks are disabled (e.g.,
`--hyperlink=none`).

‘`--full-time`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dfull_002dtime"></span>

Produce long format, and list times in full. It is equivalent to using
`--format=long` (`-l`) with `--time-style=full-iso` (see [Formatting
file timestamps](#Formatting-file-timestamps)).

‘`-g`’  
<span id="index-_002dg-3"></span>

Produce long format, but omit owner information.

‘`-G`’  
‘`--no-group`’  
<span id="index-_002dG"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dno_002dgroup"></span>

Inhibit display of group information in long format. (This is the
default in some non-GNU versions of `ls`, so we provide this option for
compatibility.)

‘`-h`’  
‘`--human-readable`’  
<span id="index-_002dh-4"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dhuman_002dreadable-1"></span> <span
id="index-human_002dreadable-output-1"></span>

Append a size letter to each size, such as ‘`M`’ for mebibytes. Powers
of 1024 are used, not 1000; ‘`M`’ stands for 1,048,576 bytes. This
option is equivalent to `--block-size=human-readable`. Use the `--si`
option if you prefer powers of 1000.

‘`-i`’  
‘`--inode`’  
<span id="index-_002di-10"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dinode"></span> <span
id="index-inode-number_002c-printing"></span>

Print the inode number (also called the file serial number and index
number) of each file to the left of the file name. (This number uniquely
identifies each file within a particular file system.)

‘`-l`’  
‘`--format=long`’  
‘`--format=verbose`’  
<span id="index-_002dl-6"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dformat-1"></span> <span
id="index-long-ls-format"></span> <span
id="index-verbose-ls-format"></span>

Produce long format. In addition to the name of each file, print the
file type, file mode bits, number of hard links, owner name, group name,
size, and timestamp (see [Formatting file
timestamps](#Formatting-file-timestamps)), normally the modification
timestamp (the mtime, see [File timestamps](#File-timestamps)). If the
owner or group name cannot be determined, print the owner or group ID
instead, right-justified as a cue that it is a number rather than a
textual name. Print question marks for other information that cannot be
determined.

Normally the size is printed as a byte count without punctuation, but
this can be overridden (see [Block size](#Block-size)). For example,
`--human-readable` (`-h`) prints an abbreviated, human-readable count,
and ‘`--block-size="'1"`’ prints a byte count with the thousands
separator of the current locale.

For each directory that is listed, preface the files with a line
‘`total blocks`’, where `blocks` is the file system allocation for all
files in that directory. The block size currently defaults to 1024
bytes, but this can be overridden (see [Block size](#Block-size)). The
`blocks` computed counts each hard link separately; this is arguably a
deficiency.

The file type is one of the following characters:

‘`-`’  
regular file

‘`b`’  
block special file

‘`c`’  
character special file

‘`C`’  
high performance (“contiguous data”) file

‘`d`’  
directory

‘`D`’  
door (Solaris)

‘`l`’  
symbolic link

‘`M`’  
off-line (“migrated”) file (Cray DMF)

‘`n`’  
network special file (HP-UX)

‘`p`’  
FIFO (named pipe)

‘`P`’  
port (Solaris)

‘`s`’  
socket

‘`?`’  
some other file type

<span id="index-permissions_002c-output-by-ls"></span>

The file mode bits listed are similar to symbolic mode specifications
(see [Symbolic Modes](#Symbolic-Modes)). But `ls` combines multiple bits
into the third character of each set of permissions as follows:

‘`s`’  
If the set-user-ID or set-group-ID bit and the corresponding executable
bit are both set.

‘`S`’  
If the set-user-ID or set-group-ID bit is set but the corresponding
executable bit is not set.

‘`t`’  
If the restricted deletion flag or sticky bit, and the other-executable
bit, are both set. The restricted deletion flag is another name for the
sticky bit. See [Mode Structure](#Mode-Structure).

‘`T`’  
If the restricted deletion flag or sticky bit is set but the
other-executable bit is not set.

‘`x`’  
If the executable bit is set and none of the above apply.

‘`-`’  
Otherwise.

Following the file mode bits is a single character that specifies
whether an alternate access method such as an access control list
applies to the file. When the character following the file mode bits is
a space, there is no alternate access method. When it is a printing
character, then there is such a method.

GNU `ls` uses a ‘`.`’ character to indicate a file with a security
context, but no other alternate access method.

A file with any other combination of alternate access methods is marked
with a ‘`+`’ character.

‘`-n`’  
‘`--numeric-uid-gid`’  
<span id="index-_002dn-10"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dnumeric_002duid_002dgid"></span> <span
id="index-numeric-uid-and-gid"></span> <span
id="index-numeric-user-and-group-IDs"></span>

Produce long format, but display right-justified numeric user and group
IDs instead of left-justified owner and group names.

‘`-o`’  
<span id="index-_002do-5"></span>

Produce long format, but omit group information. It is equivalent to
using `--format=long` (`-l`) with `--no-group` (`-G`).

‘`-s`’  
‘`--size`’  
<span id="index-_002ds-15"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dsize"></span> <span
id="index-file-system-allocation"></span> <span
id="index-size-of-files_002c-reporting"></span>

Print the file system allocation of each file to the left of the file
name. This is the amount of file system space used by the file, which is
usually a bit more than the file’s size, but it can be less if the file
has holes.

Normally the allocation is printed in units of 1024 bytes, but this can
be overridden (see [Block size](#Block-size)).

<span id="index-NFS-mounts-from-BSD-to-HP_002dUX"></span>

For files that are NFS-mounted from an HP-UX system to a BSD system,
this option reports sizes that are half the correct values. On HP-UX
systems, it reports sizes that are twice the correct values for files
that are NFS-mounted from BSD systems. This is due to a flaw in HP-UX;
it also affects the HP-UX `ls` program.

‘`--si`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dsi-1"></span> <span
id="index-SI-output-1"></span>

Append an SI-style abbreviation to each size, such as ‘`M`’ for
megabytes. Powers of 1000 are used, not 1024; ‘`M`’ stands for 1,000,000
bytes. This option is equivalent to `--block-size=si`. Use the `-h` or
`--human-readable` option if you prefer powers of 1024.

‘`-Z`’  
‘`--context`’  
<span id="index-_002dZ"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dcontext"></span> <span id="index-SELinux"></span>
<span id="index-security-context"></span>

Display the SELinux security context or ‘`?`’ if none is found. In long
format, print the security context to the left of the size column.

<span id="Sorting-the-output-1"></span>

#### 10.1.3 Sorting the output

<span id="index-sorting-ls-output"></span>

These options change the order in which `ls` sorts the information it
outputs. By default, sorting is done by character code (e.g., ASCII
order).

‘`-c`’  
‘`--time=ctime`’  
‘`--time=status`’  
<span id="index-_002dc-12"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dtime"></span> <span
id="index-ctime_002c-printing-or-sorting-by"></span> <span
id="index-status-time_002c-printing-or-sorting-by"></span> <span
id="index-use-time_002c-printing-or-sorting-files-by"></span>

In long format, print the status change timestamp (the ctime) instead of
the mtime. When sorting by time or when not using long format, sort
according to the ctime. See [File timestamps](#File-timestamps).

‘`-f`’  
<span id="index-_002df-9"></span> <span
id="index-unsorted-directory-listing"></span> <span
id="index-directory-order_002c-listing-by"></span>

Produce an unsorted directory listing. This is equivalent to the
combination of `--all` (`-a`), `--sort=none` (`-U`), `-1`,
`--color=none`, and `--hyperlink=none`, while also disabling any
previous use of `--size` (`-s`).

‘`-r`’  
‘`--reverse`’  
<span id="index-_002dr-6"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dreverse-1"></span> <span
id="index-reverse-sorting-1"></span>

Reverse whatever the sorting method is—e.g., list files in reverse
alphabetical order, youngest first, smallest first, or whatever. This
option has no effect when `--sort=none` (`-U`) is in effect.

‘`-S`’  
‘`--sort=size`’  
<span id="index-_002dS-5"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dsort-5"></span> <span
id="index-size-of-files_002c-sorting-files-by"></span>

Sort by file size, largest first.

‘`-t`’  
‘`--sort=time`’  
<span id="index-_002dt-10"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dsort-6"></span> <span
id="index-modification-timestamp_002c-sorting-files-by"></span>

Sort by modification timestamp (mtime) by default, newest first. The
timestamp to order by can be changed with the `--time` option. See [File
timestamps](#File-timestamps).

‘`-u`’  
‘`--time=atime`’  
‘`--time=access`’  
‘`--time=use`’  
<span id="index-_002du-5"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dtime-1"></span> <span
id="index-use-time_002c-printing-or-sorting-files-by-1"></span> <span
id="index-atime_002c-printing-or-sorting-files-by"></span> <span
id="index-access-timestamp_002c-printing-or-sorting-files-by"></span>

In long format, print the last access timestamp (the atime). When
sorting by time or when not using long format, sort according to the
atime. See [File timestamps](#File-timestamps).

‘`--time=birth`’  
‘`--time=creation`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dtime-2"></span> <span
id="index-birth-time_002c-printing-or-sorting-files-by"></span> <span
id="index-creation-timestamp_002c-printing-or-sorting-files-by"></span>

In long format, print the file creation timestamp if available. When
sorting by time or when not using long format, sort according to the
birth time. See [File timestamps](#File-timestamps).

‘`-U`’  
‘`--sort=none`’  
<span id="index-_002dU"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dsort-7"></span> <span
id="index-none_002c-sorting-option-for-ls"></span>

Do not sort; list the files in whatever order they are stored in the
directory. (Do not do any of the other unrelated things that `-f` does.)
This can be useful when listing large directories, where sorting can
take some time.

‘`-v`’  
‘`--sort=version`’  
<span id="index-_002dv-6"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dsort-8"></span> <span
id="index-version_002c-sorting-option-for-ls"></span>

Sort by version name and number, lowest first. It behaves like a default
sort, except that each sequence of decimal digits is treated numerically
as an index/version number. See [Version sort
ordering](#Version-sort-ordering).

‘`--sort=width`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dsort-9"></span> <span
id="index-width_002c-sorting-option-for-ls"></span>

Sort by printed width of file names. This can be useful with the
`--format=vertical` (`-C`) output format, to most densely display the
listed files.

‘`-X`’  
‘`--sort=extension`’  
<span id="index-_002dX"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dsort-10"></span> <span
id="index-extension_002c-sorting-files-by"></span>

Sort directory contents alphabetically by file extension (characters
after the last ‘`.`’); files with no extension are sorted first.

<span id="General-output-formatting-1"></span>

#### 10.1.4 General output formatting

These options affect the appearance of the overall output.

‘`--format=single-column`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dformat-2"></span> <span
id="index-single_002dcolumn-output-of-files"></span>

List one file name per line, with no other information. This is the
default for `ls` when standard output is not a terminal. See also the
`--escape` (`-b`), `--hide-control-chars` (`-q`), and `--zero` options
to disambiguate output of file names containing newline characters.

‘`-1`’  
<span id="index-_002d1-2"></span>

List one file per line. This is like `--format=single-column` except
that it has no effect if long format is also in effect.

‘`-C`’  
‘`--format=vertical`’  
<span id="index-_002dC-2"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dformat-3"></span> <span
id="index-vertical-sorted-files-in-columns"></span>

List files in columns, sorted vertically, with no other information.
This is the default for `ls` if standard output is a terminal. It is
always the default for the `dir` program. GNU `ls` uses variable width
columns to display as many files as possible in the fewest lines.

‘`--color [=when]`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dcolor"></span> <span
id="index-color_002c-distinguishing-file-types-with"></span>

Specify whether to use color for distinguishing file types; `when` may
be omitted, or one of:

-   none <span id="index-none-color-option"></span> - Do not use color
    at all. This is the default.
-   auto <span id="index-auto-color-option"></span> <span
    id="index-terminal_002c-using-color-iff"></span> - Only use color if
    standard output is a terminal.
-   always <span id="index-always-color-option"></span> - Always use
    color.

Specifying `--color` and no `when` is equivalent to `--color=always`. If
piping a colored listing through a pager like `less`, use the pager’s
`-R` option to pass the color codes to the terminal.

<span id="index-LS_005fCOLORS"></span> <span
id="index-SHELL-environment-variable_002c-and-color"></span>

Using the `--color` option may incur a noticeable performance penalty
when run in a large directory, because the default settings require that
`ls` `stat` every single file it lists. However, if you would like most
of the file-type coloring but can live without the other coloring
options (e.g., executable, orphan, sticky, other-writable, capability),
use `dircolors` to set the `LS_COLORS` environment variable like this,

<div class="example">

‘`--classify [=when]`’  
‘`--indicator-style=classify`’  
<span id="index-_002dF-3"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dclassify"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dindicator_002dstyle"></span> <span
id="index-file-type-and-executables_002c-marking"></span> <span
id="index-executables-and-file-type_002c-marking"></span>

Append a character to each file name indicating the file type. Also, for
regular files that are executable, append ‘`*`’. The file type
indicators are ‘`/`’ for directories, ‘`@`’ for symbolic links, ‘`|`’
for FIFOs, ‘`=`’ for sockets, ‘`>`’ for doors, and nothing for regular
files. `when` may be omitted, or one of:

-   none <span id="index-none-classify-option"></span> - Do not
    classify. This is the default.
-   auto <span id="index-auto-classify-option"></span> <span
    id="index-terminal_002c-using-classify-iff"></span> - Only classify
    if standard output is a terminal.
-   always <span id="index-always-classify-option"></span> - Always
    classify.

Specifying `--classify` and no `when` is equivalent to
`--classify=always`. Do not follow symbolic links listed on the command
line unless the `--dereference-command-line` (`-H`), `--dereference`
(`-L`), or `--dereference-command-line-symlink-to-dir` options are
specified.

‘`--file-type`’  
‘`--indicator-style=file-type`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dfile_002dtype"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dindicator_002dstyle-1"></span> <span
id="index-file-type_002c-marking"></span>

Append a character to each file name indicating the file type. This is
like `--classify` (`-F`, except that executables are not marked.

‘`--hyperlink [=when]`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dhyperlink"></span> <span
id="index-hyperlink_002c-linking-to-files"></span>

Output codes recognized by some terminals to link to files using the
‘`file://`’ URI format. `when` may be omitted, or one of:

-   none <span id="index-none-hyperlink-option"></span> - Do not use
    hyperlinks at all. This is the default.
-   auto <span id="index-auto-hyperlink-option"></span> <span
    id="index-terminal_002c-using-hyperlink-iff"></span> - Only use
    hyperlinks if standard output is a terminal.
-   always <span id="index-always-hyperlink-option"></span> - Always use
    hyperlinks.

Specifying `--hyperlink` and no `when` is equivalent to
`--hyperlink=always`.

‘`--indicator-style=word`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dindicator_002dstyle-2"></span>

Append a character indicator with style `word` to entry names, as
follows:

‘`none`’  
Do not append any character indicator; this is the default.

‘`slash`’  
Append ‘`/`’ for directories. This is the same as the `-p` option.

‘`file-type`’  
Append ‘`/`’ for directories, ‘`@`’ for symbolic links, ‘`|`’ for FIFOs,
‘`=`’ for sockets, and nothing for regular files. This is the same as
the `--file-type` option.

‘`classify`’  
Append ‘`*`’ for executable regular files, otherwise behave as for
‘`file-type`’. This is the same as the `--classify` (`-F`) option.

‘`-k`’  
‘`--kibibytes`’  
<span id="index-_002dk-3"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dkibibytes"></span>

Set the default block size to its normal value of 1024 bytes, overriding
any contrary specification in environment variables (see [Block
size](#Block-size)). If `--block-size`, `--human-readable` (`-h`), or
`--si` options are used, they take precedence even if `--kibibytes`
(`-k`) is placed after

The `--kibibytes` (`-k`) option affects the per-directory block count
written in long format, and the file system allocation written by the
`--size` (`-s`) option. It does not affect the file size in bytes that
is written in long format.

‘`-m`’  
‘`--format=commas`’  
<span id="index-_002dm-3"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dformat-4"></span> <span
id="index-commas_002c-outputting-between-files"></span>

separated by ‘`, `’ (a comma and a space), and with no other
information.

‘`-p`’  
‘`--indicator-style=slash`’  
<span id="index-_002dp-1"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dindicator_002dstyle-3"></span> <span
id="index-file-type_002c-marking-1"></span>

Append a ‘`/`’ to directory names.

‘`-x`’  
‘`--format=across`’  
‘`--format=horizontal`’  
<span id="index-_002dx-2"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dformat-5"></span> <span
id="index-across_002c-listing-files"></span> <span
id="index-horizontal_002c-listing-files"></span>

List the files in columns, sorted horizontally.

‘`-T cols`’  
‘`--tabsize=cols`’  
<span id="index-_002dT-4"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dtabsize"></span>

Assume that each tab stop is `cols` columns wide. The default is 8. `ls`
uses tabs where possible in the output, for efficiency. If `cols` is
zero, do not use tabs at all.

Some terminal emulators might not properly align columns to the right of
a TAB following a non-ASCII byte. You can avoid that issue by using the
`-T0` option or put `TABSIZE=0` in your environment, to tell `ls` to
align using spaces, not tabs.

‘`-w cols`’  
‘`--width=cols`’  
<span id="index-_002dw-10"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dwidth-5"></span> <span id="index-COLUMNS"></span>

Assume the screen is `cols` columns wide. The default is taken from the
terminal settings if possible; otherwise the environment variable
`COLUMNS` is used if it is set; otherwise the default is 80. With a
`cols` value of ‘`0`’, there is no limit on the length of the output
line, and that single output line will be delimited with spaces, not
tabs.

‘`--zero`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dzero-1"></span> <span
id="index-output-NUL_002dbyte_002dterminated-lines-1"></span>

Output a zero byte (ASCII NUL) at the end of each line, rather than a
newline. This option enables other programs to parse the output even
when that output would contain data with embedded newlines. This option
is incompatible with the `--dired` (`-D`) option. This option also
implies the options `--show-control-chars`, `-1`, `--color=none`, and
`--quoting-style=literal` (`-N`).

<span id="Formatting-file-timestamps-1"></span>

#### 10.1.5 Formatting file timestamps

By default, file timestamps are listed in abbreviated form, using a date
like ‘`Mar 30  2020`’ for non-recent timestamps, and a date-without-year
and time like ‘`Mar 30 23:45`’ for recent timestamps. This format can
change depending on the current locale as detailed below.

<span id="index-clock-skew"></span>

A timestamp is considered to be *recent* if it is less than six months
old, and is not dated in the future. If a timestamp dated today is not
listed in recent form, the timestamp is in the future, which means you
probably have clock skew problems which may break programs like `make`
that rely on file timestamps. See [File timestamps](#File-timestamps).

<span id="index-TZ-1"></span>

Timestamps are listed according to the time zone rules specified by the
`TZ` environment variable, or by the system default rules if `TZ` is not
set. See [Specifying the Time Zone with
`TZ`](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_mono/libc.html#TZ-Variable)
in The GNU C Library Reference Manual.

The following option changes how file timestamps are printed.

‘`--time-style=style`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dtime_002dstyle"></span> <span
id="index-time-style"></span>

List timestamps in style `style`. The `style` should be one of the
following:

‘`+format`’  
<span id="index-LC_005fTIME-2"></span>

List timestamps using `format`, where `format` is interpreted like the
format argument of `date` (see [date invocation](#date-invocation)). For
example, `--time-style="+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"` causes `ls` to list
timestamps like ‘`2020-03-30 23:45:56`’. As with `date`, `format`’s
interpretation is affected by the `LC_TIME` locale category.

If `format` contains two format strings separated by a newline, the
former is used for non-recent files and the latter for recent files; if
you want output columns to line up, you may need to insert spaces in one
of the two formats.

‘`full-iso`’  
List timestamps in full using ISO 8601-like date, time, and time zone
components with nanosecond precision, e.g.,
‘`2020-07-21 23:45:56.477817180 -0400`’. This style is equivalent to
‘`+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%N %z`’.

This is useful because the time output includes all the information that
is available from the operating system. For example, this can help
explain `make`’s behavior, since GNU `make` uses the full timestamp to
determine whether a file is out of date.

‘`long-iso`’  
List ISO 8601 date and time components with minute precision, e.g.,
‘`2020-03-30 23:45`’. These timestamps are shorter than ‘`full-iso`’
timestamps, and are usually good enough for everyday work. This style is
equivalent to ‘`+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M`’.

‘`iso`’  
List ISO 8601 dates for non-recent timestamps (e.g., ‘`2020-03-30 `’),
and ISO 8601-like month, day, hour, and minute for recent timestamps
(e.g., ‘`03-30 23:45`’). These timestamps are uglier than ‘`long-iso`’
timestamps, but they carry nearly the same information in a smaller
space and their brevity helps `ls` output fit within traditional
80-column output lines. The following two `ls` invocations are
equivalent:

<div class="example">

``` example
newline='
'
ls -l --time-style="+%Y-%m-%d $newline%m-%d %H:%M"
ls -l --time-style="iso"
```

</div>

‘`locale`’  
<span id="index-LC_005fTIME-3"></span>

List timestamps in a locale-dependent form. For example, a French locale
might list non-recent timestamps like ‘`30 mars   2020`’ and recent
timestamps like ‘`30 mars  23:45`’. Locale-dependent timestamps
typically consume more space than ‘`iso`’ timestamps and are harder for
programs to parse because locale conventions vary so widely, but they
are easier for many people to read.

The `LC_TIME` locale category specifies the timestamp format. The
default POSIX locale uses timestamps like ‘`Mar 30  2020`’ and
‘`Mar 30 23:45`’; in this locale, the following two `ls` invocations are
equivalent:

<div class="example">

``` example
newline='
'
ls -l --time-style="+%b %e  %Y$newline%b %e %H:%M"
ls -l --time-style="locale"
```

</div>

Other locales behave differently. For example, in a German locale,
`--time-style="locale"` might be equivalent to
`--time-style="+%e. %b %Y $newline%e. %b %H:%M"` and might generate
timestamps like ‘`30. Mär 2020 `’ and ‘`30. Mär 23:45`’.

‘`posix-style`’  
<span id="index-LC_005fTIME-4"></span>

List POSIX-locale timestamps if the `LC_TIME` locale category is POSIX,
`style` timestamps otherwise. For example, the ‘`posix-long-iso`’ style
lists timestamps like ‘`Mar 30  2020`’ and ‘`Mar 30 23:45`’ when in the
POSIX locale, and like ‘`2020-03-30 23:45`’ otherwise.

<span id="index-TIME_005fSTYLE"></span>

You can specify the default value of the `--time-style` option with the
environment variable `TIME_STYLE`; if `TIME_STYLE` is not set the
default style is ‘`locale`’. GNU Emacs 21.3 and later use the `--dired`
option and therefore can parse any date format, but if you are using
Emacs 21.1 or 21.2 and specify a non-POSIX locale you may need to set
‘`TIME_STYLE="posix-long-iso"`’.

To avoid certain denial-of-service attacks, timestamps that would be
longer than 1000 bytes may be treated as errors.

#### 10.1.6 Formatting the file names

These options change how file names themselves are printed.

‘`-b`’  
‘`--escape`’  
‘`--quoting-style=escape`’  
<span id="index-_002db-12"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002descape"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dquoting_002dstyle"></span> <span
id="index-backslash-sequences-for-file-names"></span>

Quote nongraphic characters in file names using alphabetic and octal
backslash sequences like those used in C.

‘`-N`’  
‘`--literal`’  
‘`--quoting-style=literal`’  
<span id="index-_002dN-2"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dliteral"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dquoting_002dstyle-1"></span>

Do not quote file names. However, with `ls` nongraphic characters are
still printed as question marks if the output is a terminal and you do
not specify the `--show-control-chars` option.

‘`-q`’  
‘`--hide-control-chars`’  
<span id="index-_002dq-3"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dhide_002dcontrol_002dchars"></span>

Print question marks instead of nongraphic characters in file names.
This is the default if the output is a terminal and the program is `ls`.

‘`-Q`’  
‘`--quote-name`’  
‘`--quoting-style=c`’  
<span id="index-_002dQ"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dquote_002dname"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dquoting_002dstyle-2"></span>

Enclose file names in double quotes and quote nongraphic characters as
in C.

‘`--quoting-style=word`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dquoting_002dstyle-3"></span> <span
id="index-quoting-style"></span>

Use style `word` to quote file names and other strings that may contain
arbitrary characters. The `word` should be one of the following:

‘`literal`’  
Output strings as-is; this is the same as the `--literal` (`-N`) option.

‘`shell`’  
Quote strings for the shell if they contain shell metacharacters or
would cause ambiguous output. The quoting is suitable for
POSIX-compatible shells like `bash`, but it does not always work for
incompatible shells like `csh`.

‘`shell-always`’  
Quote strings for the shell, even if they would normally not require
quoting.

‘`shell-escape`’  
Like ‘`shell`’, but also quoting non-printable characters using the
POSIX proposed ‘`$''`’ syntax suitable for most shells.

‘`shell-escape-always`’  
Like ‘`shell-escape`’, but quote strings even if they would normally not
require quoting.

‘`c`’  
Quote strings as for C character string literals, including the
surrounding double-quote characters; this is the same as the
`--quote-name` (`-Q`) option.

‘`escape`’  
Quote strings as for C character string literals, except omit the
surrounding double-quote characters; this is the same as the `--escape`
(`-b`) option.

‘`clocale`’  
Quote strings as for C character string literals, except use surrounding
quotation marks appropriate for the locale.

‘`locale`’  
Quote strings as for C character string literals, except use surrounding
quotation marks appropriate for the locale, and quote 'like this'
instead of "like this" in the default C locale. This looks nicer on many
displays.

You can specify the default value of the `--quoting-style` option with
the environment variable `QUOTING_STYLE`. If that environment variable
is not set, the default value is ‘`shell-escape`’ when the output is a
terminal, and ‘`literal`’ otherwise.

‘`--show-control-chars`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dshow_002dcontrol_002dchars-1"></span>

Print nongraphic characters as-is in file names. This is the default
unless the output is a terminal and the program is `ls`.

in columns, sorted vertically, and special characters are represented by
backslash escape sequences.

### 10.4 `dircolors`: Color setup for `ls`

<span id="index-dircolors"></span> <span id="index-color-setup"></span>
<span id="index-setup-for-color"></span>

`dircolors` outputs a sequence of shell commands to set up the terminal
for color output from `ls` (and `dir`, etc.). Typical usage:

<div class="example">

``` example
eval "$(dircolors [option]… [file])"
```

</div>

If `file` is specified, `dircolors` reads it to determine which colors
to use for which file types and extensions. Otherwise, a precompiled
database is used. For details on the format of these files, run
‘`dircolors --print-database`’.

To make `dircolors` read a `~/.dircolors` file if it exists, you can put
the following lines in your `~/.bashrc` (or adapt them to your favorite
shell):

<div class="example">

``` example
d=.dircolors
test -r $d && eval "$(dircolors $d)"
```

</div>

<span id="index-LS_005fCOLORS-1"></span> <span
id="index-SHELL-environment-variable_002c-and-color-1"></span>

The output is a shell command to set the `LS_COLORS` environment
variable. You can specify the shell syntax to use on the command line,
or `dircolors` will guess it from the value of the `SHELL` environment
variable.

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`-b`’  
‘`--sh`’  
‘`--bourne-shell`’  
<span id="index-_002db-13"></span> <span id="index-_002d_002dsh"></span>

id="index-Bourne-shell-syntax-for-color-setup"></span> <span
id="index-sh-syntax-for-color-setup"></span>

Output Bourne shell commands. This is the default if the `SHELL`
environment variable is set and does not end with ‘`csh`’ or ‘`tcsh`’.

‘`-c`’  
‘`--csh`’  
‘`--c-shell`’  
<span id="index-_002dc-13"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dcsh"></span> <span

id="index-C-shell-syntax-for-color-setup"></span> <span
id="index-csh-syntax-for-color-setup"></span>

Output C shell commands. This is the default if `SHELL` ends with `csh`
or `tcsh`.

‘`-p`’  
‘`--print-database`’  
<span id="index-_002dp-2"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dprint_002ddatabase"></span> <span
id="index-color-database_002c-printing"></span> <span
id="index-database-for-color-setup_002c-printing"></span> <span
id="index-printing-color-database"></span>

Print the (compiled-in) default color configuration database. This
output is itself a valid configuration file, and is fairly descriptive
of the possibilities.

‘`--print-ls-colors`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dprint_002dls_002dcolors"></span> <span
id="index-printing-ls-colors"></span>

Print the LS_COLORS entries on separate lines, each colored as per the
color they represent.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

### 11.1 `cp`: Copy files and directories

<span id="index-cp"></span> <span
id="index-copying-files-and-directories"></span> <span
id="index-files_002c-copying"></span> <span
id="index-directories_002c-copying"></span>

`cp` copies files (or, optionally, directories). The copy is completely
independent of the original. You can either copy one file to another, or
copy arbitrarily many files to a destination directory. Synopses:

<div class="example">

``` example
cp [option]… [-T] source dest
cp [option]… source… directory
cp [option]… -t directory source…
```

</div>

-   If two file names are given, `cp` copies the first file to the
    second.
-   If the `--target-directory` (`-t`) option is given, or failing that
    if the last file is a directory and the `--no-target-directory`
    (`-T`) option is not given, `cp` copies each `source` file to the
    specified directory, using the `source`s’ names.

Generally, files are written just as they are read. For exceptions, see
the `--sparse` option below.

By default, `cp` does not copy directories. However, the `-R`, `-a`, and
`-r` options cause `cp` to copy recursively by descending into source
directories and copying files to corresponding destination directories.

When copying from a symbolic link, `cp` normally follows the link only
when not copying recursively or when `--link` (`-l`) is used. This
default can be overridden with the `--archive` (`-a`), `-d`,
`--dereference` (`-L`), `--no-dereference` (`-P`), and `-H` options. If
more than one of these options is specified, the last one silently
overrides the others.

When copying to a symbolic link, `cp` follows the link only when it
refers to an existing regular file. However, when copying to a dangling
symbolic link, `cp` refuses by default, and fails with a diagnostic,
since the operation is inherently dangerous. This behavior is contrary
to historical practice and to POSIX. Set `POSIXLY_CORRECT` to make `cp`
attempt to create the target of a dangling destination symlink, in spite
of the possible risk. Also, when an option like `--backup` or `--link`
acts to rename or remove the destination before copying, `cp` renames or
removes the symbolic link rather than the file it points to.

By default, `cp` copies the contents of special files only when not
copying recursively. This default can be overridden with the
`--copy-contents` option.

<span id="index-self_002dbackups"></span> <span
id="index-backups_002c-making-only"></span>

`cp` generally refuses to copy a file onto itself, with the following
exception: if `--force --backup` is specified with `source` and `dest`
identical, and referring to a regular file, `cp` will make a backup
file, either regular or numbered, as specified in the usual ways (see
[Backup options](#Backup-options)). This is useful when you simply want
to make a backup of an existing file before changing it.

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`-a`’  
‘`--archive`’  
<span id="index-_002da-7"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002darchive"></span>

Preserve as much as possible of the structure and attributes of the
original files in the copy (but do not attempt to preserve internal
directory structure; i.e., ‘`ls -U`’ may list the entries in a copied
directory in a different order). Try to preserve SELinux security
context and extended attributes (xattr), but ignore any failure to do
that and print no corresponding diagnostic. Equivalent to
`-dR --preserve=all` with the reduced diagnostics.

‘`--attributes-only`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dattributes_002donly"></span>

Copy only the specified attributes of the source file to the
destination. If the destination already exists, do not alter its
contents. See the `--preserve` option for controlling which attributes
to copy.

‘`-b`’  
‘`--backup[=method]`’  
<span id="index-_002db-14"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dbackup-1"></span> <span
id="index-VERSION_005fCONTROL-1"></span> <span
id="index-backups_002c-making-1"></span>

See [Backup options](#Backup-options). Make a backup of each file that
would otherwise be overwritten or removed. As a special case, `cp` makes
a backup of `source` when the force and backup options are given and
`source` and `dest` are the same name for an existing, regular file. One
useful application of this combination of options is this tiny Bourne
shell script:

<div class="example">

``` example
#!/bin/sh
# Usage: backup FILE...
# Create a GNU-style backup of each listed FILE.
fail=0
for i; do
  cp --backup --force --preserve=all -- "$i" "$i" || fail=1
done
exit $fail
```

</div>

‘`--copy-contents`’  
<span id="index-directories_002c-copying-recursively"></span> <span
id="index-copying-directories-recursively"></span> <span
id="index-recursively-copying-directories"></span> <span
id="index-non_002ddirectories_002c-copying-as-special-files"></span>

If copying recursively, copy the contents of any special files (e.g.,
FIFOs and device files) as if they were regular files. This means trying
to read the data in each source file and writing it to the destination.
It is usually a mistake to use this option, as it normally has
undesirable effects on special files like FIFOs and the ones typically
found in the `/dev` directory. In most cases, `cp -R --copy-contents`
will hang indefinitely trying to read from FIFOs and special files like
`/dev/console`, and it will fill up your destination file system if you
use it to copy `/dev/zero`. This option has no effect unless copying
recursively, and it does not affect the copying of symbolic links.

‘`-d`’  
<span id="index-_002dd-11"></span> <span
id="index-symbolic-links_002c-copying"></span> <span
id="index-hard-links_002c-preserving"></span>

Copy symbolic links as symbolic links rather than copying the files that
they point to, and preserve hard links between source files in the
copies. Equivalent to `--no-dereference --preserve=links`.

‘`-f`’  
‘`--force`’  
<span id="index-_002df-10"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dforce"></span>

When copying without this option and an existing destination file cannot
be opened for writing, the copy fails. However, with `--force`, when a
destination file cannot be opened, `cp` then tries to recreate the file
by first removing it. Note `--force` alone will not remove dangling
symlinks. When this option is combined with `--link` (`-l`) or
`--symbolic-link` (`-s`), the destination link is replaced, and unless
`--backup` (`-b`) is also given there is no brief moment when the
destination does not exist. Also see the description of
`--remove-destination`.

This option is independent of the `--interactive` or `-i` option:
neither cancels the effect of the other.

This option is ignored when the `--no-clobber` or `-n` option is also
used.

‘`-H`’  
<span id="index-_002dH-2"></span>

If a command line argument specifies a symbolic link, then copy the file
it points to rather than the symbolic link itself. However, copy
(preserving its nature) any symbolic link that is encountered via
recursive traversal.

‘`-i`’  
‘`--interactive`’  
<span id="index-_002di-11"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dinteractive"></span>

When copying a file other than a directory, prompt whether to overwrite
an existing destination file. The `-i` option overrides a previous `-n`
option.

‘`-l`’  
‘`--link`’  
<span id="index-_002dl-7"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dlink"></span>

Make hard links instead of copies of non-directories.

‘`-L`’  
‘`--dereference`’  
<span id="index-_002dL-3"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002ddereference-1"></span>

Follow symbolic links when copying from them. With this option, `cp`
cannot create a symbolic link. For example, a symlink (to regular file)
in the source tree will be copied to a regular file in the destination
tree.

‘`-n`’  
‘`--no-clobber`’  
<span id="index-_002dn-11"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dno_002dclobber"></span>

Do not overwrite an existing file; silently do nothing instead. This
option overrides a previous `-i` option. This option is mutually
exclusive with `-b` or `--backup` option.

‘`-P`’  
‘`--no-dereference`’  
<span id="index-_002dP-1"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dno_002ddereference"></span> <span
id="index-symbolic-links_002c-copying-1"></span>

Copy symbolic links as symbolic links rather than copying the files that
they point to. This option affects only symbolic links in the source;
symbolic links in the destination are always followed if possible.

‘`-p`’  
‘`--preserve[=attribute_list]`’  
<span id="index-_002dp-3"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dpreserve"></span> <span
id="index-file-information_002c-preserving_002c-extended-attributes_002c-xattr"></span>

Preserve the specified attributes of the original files. If specified,
the `attribute_list` must be a comma-separated list of one or more of
the following strings:

‘`mode`’  
Preserve the file mode bits and access control lists.

‘`ownership`’  
Preserve the owner and group. On most modern systems, only users with
appropriate privileges may change the owner of a file, and ordinary
users may preserve the group ownership of a file only if they happen to
be a member of the desired group.

‘`timestamps`’  
Preserve the times of last access and last modification, when possible.
On older systems, it is not possible to preserve these attributes when
the affected file is a symbolic link. However, many systems now provide
the `utimensat` function, which makes it possible even for symbolic
links.

‘`links`’  
Preserve in the destination files any links between corresponding source
files. Note that with `-L` or `-H`, this option can convert symbolic
links to hard links. For example,

<div class="example">

``` example
$ mkdir c; : > a; ln -s a b; cp -aH a b c; ls -i1 c
74161745 a
74161745 b
```

</div>

Note the inputs: `b` is a symlink to regular file `a`, yet the files in
destination directory, `c/`, are hard-linked. Since `-a` implies
`--no-dereference` it would copy the symlink, but the later `-H` tells
`cp` to dereference the command line arguments where it then sees two
files with the same inode number. Then the `--preserve=links` option
also implied by `-a` will preserve the perceived hard link.

Here is a similar example that exercises `cp`’s `-L` option:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ mkdir b c; (cd b; : > a; ln -s a b); cp -aL b c; ls -i1 c/b
74163295 a
74163295 b
```

</div>

‘`context`’  
Preserve SELinux security context of the file, or fail with full
diagnostics.

‘`xattr`’  
Preserve extended attributes of the file, or fail with full diagnostics.
If `cp` is built without xattr support, ignore this option. If SELinux
context, ACLs or Capabilities are implemented using xattrs, they are
preserved implicitly by this option as well, i.e., even without
specifying `--preserve=mode` or `--preserve=context`.

‘`all`’  
Preserve all file attributes. Equivalent to specifying all of the above,
but with the difference that failure to preserve SELinux security
context or extended attributes does not change `cp`’s exit status. In
contrast to `-a`, all but ‘`Operation not supported`’ warnings are
output.

Using `--preserve` with no `attribute_list` is equivalent to
`--preserve=mode,ownership,timestamps`.

In the absence of this option, the permissions of existing destination
files are unchanged. Each new file is created with the mode of the
corresponding source file minus the set-user-ID, set-group-ID, and
sticky bits as the create mode; the operating system then applies either
the umask or a default ACL, possibly resulting in a more restrictive
file mode. See [File permissions](#File-permissions).

‘`--no-preserve=attribute_list`’  
<span id="index-file-information_002c-preserving"></span>

Do not preserve the specified attributes. The `attribute_list` has the
same form as for `--preserve`.

‘`--parents`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dparents"></span> <span
id="index-parent-directories-and-cp"></span>

Form the name of each destination file by appending to the target
directory a slash and the specified name of the source file. The last
argument given to `cp` must be the name of an existing directory. For
example, the command:

<div class="example">

``` example
cp --parents a/b/c existing_dir
```

</div>

copies the file `a/b/c` to `existing_dir/a/b/c`, creating any missing
intermediate directories.

‘`-R`’  
‘`-r`’  
‘`--recursive`’  
<span id="index-_002dR-3"></span> <span id="index-_002dr-7"></span>
<span id="index-_002d_002drecursive-1"></span> <span
id="index-directories_002c-copying-recursively-1"></span> <span
id="index-copying-directories-recursively-1"></span> <span
id="index-recursively-copying-directories-1"></span> <span
id="index-non_002ddirectories_002c-copying-as-special-files-1"></span>

Copy directories recursively. By default, do not follow symbolic links
in the source unless used together with the `--link` (`-l`) option; see
the `--archive` (`-a`), `-d`, `--dereference` (`-L`), `--no-dereference`
(`-P`), and `-H` options. Special files are copied by creating a
destination file of the same type as the source; see the
`--copy-contents` option. It is not portable to use `-r` to copy
symbolic links or special files. On some non-GNU systems, `-r` implies
the equivalent of `-L` and `--copy-contents` for historical reasons.
Also, it is not portable to use `-R` to copy symbolic links unless you
also specify `-P`, as POSIX allows implementations that dereference
symbolic links by default.

‘`--reflink[=when]`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dreflink_005b_003dwhen_005d"></span> <span
id="index-COW"></span> <span id="index-clone"></span> <span
id="index-copy-on-write"></span>

Perform a lightweight, copy-on-write (COW) copy, if supported by the
file system. Once it has succeeded, beware that the source and
destination files share the same data blocks as long as they remain
unmodified. Thus, if an I/O error affects data blocks of one of the
files, the other suffers the same fate.

The `when` value can be one of the following:

‘`always`’  
If the copy-on-write operation is not supported then report the failure
for each file and exit with a failure status. Plain `--reflink` is
equivalent to `--reflink=when`.

‘`auto`’  
If the copy-on-write operation is not supported then fall back to the
standard copy behavior. This is the default if no `--reflink` option is
given.

‘`never`’  
Disable copy-on-write operation and use the standard copy behavior.

This option is overridden by the `--link`, `--symbolic-link` and
`--attributes-only` options, thus allowing it to be used to configure
the default data copying behavior for `cp`.

‘`--remove-destination`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dremove_002ddestination"></span>

Remove each existing destination file before attempting to open it
(contrast with `-f` above).

‘`--sparse=when`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dsparse_003dwhen"></span> <span
id="index-sparse-files_002c-copying"></span> <span
id="index-holes_002c-copying-files-with"></span> <span
id="index-read-system-call_002c-and-holes"></span>

A *sparse file* contains *holes*—a sequence of zero bytes that does not
occupy any file system blocks; the ‘`read`’ system call reads these as
zeros. This can both save considerable space and increase speed, since
many binary files contain lots of consecutive zero bytes. By default,
`cp` detects holes in input source files via a crude heuristic and makes
the corresponding output file sparse as well. Only regular files may be
sparse.

The `when` value can be one of the following:

‘`auto`’  
The default behavior: if the input file is sparse, attempt to make the
output file sparse, too. However, if an output file exists but refers to
a non-regular file, then do not attempt to make it sparse.

‘`always`’  
For each sufficiently long sequence of zero bytes in the input file,
attempt to create a corresponding hole in the output file, even if the
input file does not appear to be sparse. This is useful when the input
file resides on a file system that does not support sparse files (for
example, ‘`efs`’ file systems in SGI IRIX 5.3 and earlier), but the
output file is on a type of file system that does support them. Holes
may be created only in regular files, so if the destination file is of
some other type, `cp` does not even try to make it sparse.

‘`never`’  
Never make the output file sparse. This is useful in creating a file for
use with the `mkswap` command, since such a file must not have any
holes.

For example, with the following alias, `cp` will use the minimum amount
of space supported by the file system. (Older versions of `cp` can also
benefit from `--reflink=auto` here.)

<div class="example">

``` example
alias cp='cp --sparse=always'
```

</div>

‘`--strip-trailing-slashes`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dstrip_002dtrailing_002dslashes"></span> <span
id="index-stripping-trailing-slashes"></span>

Remove any trailing slashes from each `source` argument. See [Trailing
slashes](#Trailing-slashes).

‘`-s`’  
‘`--symbolic-link`’  
<span id="index-_002ds-16"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dsymbolic_002dlink"></span> <span
id="index-symbolic-links_002c-copying-with"></span>

Make symbolic links instead of copies of non-directories. All source
file names must be absolute (starting with ‘`/`’) unless the destination
files are in the current directory. This option merely results in an
error message on systems that do not support symbolic links.

‘`-S suffix`’  
‘`--suffix=suffix`’  
<span id="index-_002dS-6"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dsuffix-1"></span>

Append `suffix` to each backup file made with `-b`. See [Backup
options](#Backup-options).

‘`-t directory`’  
‘`--target-directory=directory`’  
<span id="index-_002dt-11"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dtarget_002ddirectory-1"></span> <span
id="index-target-directory-3"></span> <span
id="index-destination-directory-2"></span>

Specify the destination `directory`. See [Target
directory](#Target-directory).

‘`-T`’  
‘`--no-target-directory`’  
<span id="index-_002dT-5"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dno_002dtarget_002ddirectory-1"></span> <span
id="index-target-directory-4"></span> <span
id="index-destination-directory-3"></span>

Do not treat the last operand specially when it is a directory or a
symbolic link to a directory. See [Target directory](#Target-directory).

‘`-u`’  
‘`--update`’  
<span id="index-_002du-6"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dupdate"></span> <span
id="index-newer-files_002c-copying-only"></span>

Do not copy a non-directory that has an existing destination with the
same or newer modification timestamp. If timestamps are being preserved,
the comparison is to the source timestamp truncated to the resolutions
of the destination file system and of the system calls used to update
timestamps; this avoids duplicate work if several ‘`cp -pu`’ commands
are executed with the same source and destination. This option is
ignored if the `-n` or `--no-clobber` option is also specified. Also, if
`--preserve=links` is also specified (like with ‘`cp -au`’ for example),
that will take precedence; consequently, depending on the order that
files are processed from the source, newer files in the destination may
be replaced, to mirror hard links in the source.

‘`-v`’  
‘`--verbose`’  
<span id="index-_002dv-7"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dverbose-3"></span>

Print the name of each file before copying it.

‘`-x`’  
‘`--one-file-system`’  
<span id="index-_002dx-3"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002done_002dfile_002dsystem"></span> <span
id="index-file-systems_002c-omitting-copying-to-different"></span>

Skip subdirectories that are on different file systems from the one that
the copy started on. However, mount point directories *are* copied.

‘`-Z`’  
‘`--context[=context]`’  
<span id="index-_002dZ-1"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dcontext-1"></span> <span
id="index-SELinux_002c-setting_002frestoring-security-context"></span>
<span id="index-security-context-1"></span>

Without a specified `context`, adjust the SELinux security context
according to the system default type for destination files, similarly to
the `restorecon` command. The long form of this option with a specific
context specified, will set the context for newly created files only.
With a specified context, if both SELinux and SMACK are disabled, a
warning is issued. This option is mutually exclusive with the
`--preserve=context` option, and overrides the `--preserve=all` and `-a`
options.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

### 11.2 `dd`: Convert and copy a file

<span id="index-dd"></span> <span
id="index-converting-while-copying-a-file"></span>

`dd` copies input to output with a changeable I/O block size, while
optionally performing conversions on the data. Synopses:

<div class="example">

``` example
dd [operand]…
dd option
```

</div>

The only options are `--help` and `--version`. See [Common
options](#Common-options).

By default, `dd` copies standard input to standard output. To copy, `dd`
repeatedly does the following steps in order:

1.  Read an input block.
2.  If converting via ‘`sync`’, pad as needed to meet the input block
    size. Pad with spaces if converting via ‘`block`’ or ‘`unblock`’,
    NUL bytes otherwise.
3.  If ‘`bs=`’ is given and no conversion mentioned in steps (4) or (5)
    is given, output the data as a single block and skip all remaining
    steps.
4.  If the ‘`swab`’ conversion is given, swap each pair of input bytes.
    If the input data length is odd, preserve the last input byte (since
    there is nothing to swap it with).
5.  If any of the conversions ‘`swab`’, ‘`block`’, ‘`unblock`’,
    ‘`lcase`’, ‘`ucase`’, ‘`ascii`’, ‘`ebcdic`’ and ‘`ibm`’ are given,
    do these conversions. These conversions operate independently of
    input blocking, and might deal with records that span block
    boundaries.
6.  Aggregate the resulting data into output blocks of the specified
    size, and output each output block in turn. Do not pad the last
    output block; it can be shorter than usual.

`dd` accepts the following operands, whose syntax was inspired by the DD
(data definition) statement of OS/360 JCL.

‘`if=file`’  
<span id="index-if"></span>

Read from `file` instead of standard input.

‘`of=file`’  
<span id="index-of"></span>

Write to `file` instead of standard output. Unless ‘`conv=notrunc`’ is
given, truncate `file` before writing it.

‘`ibs=bytes`’  
<span id="index-ibs"></span> <span
id="index-block-size-of-input"></span> <span
id="index-input-block-size"></span>

Set the input block size to `bytes`. This makes `dd` read `bytes` per
block. The default is 512 bytes.

‘`obs=bytes`’  
<span id="index-obs"></span> <span
id="index-block-size-of-output"></span> <span
id="index-output-block-size"></span>

Set the output block size to `bytes`. This makes `dd` write `bytes` per
block. The default is 512 bytes.

‘`bs=bytes`’  
<span id="index-bs"></span> <span id="index-block-size-1"></span>

Set both input and output block sizes to `bytes`. This makes `dd` read
and write `bytes` per block, overriding any ‘`ibs`’ and ‘`obs`’
settings. In addition, if no data-transforming `conv` operand is
specified, input is copied to the output as soon as it’s read, even if
it is smaller than the block size.

‘`cbs=bytes`’  
<span id="index-cbs"></span> <span
id="index-block-size-of-conversion"></span> <span
id="index-conversion-block-size"></span> <span
id="index-fixed_002dlength-records_002c-converting-to-variable_002dlength"></span>
<span
id="index-variable_002dlength-records_002c-converting-to-fixed_002dlength"></span>

Set the conversion block size to `bytes`. When converting
variable-length records to fixed-length ones (`conv=block`) or the
reverse (`conv=unblock`), use `bytes` as the fixed record length.

‘`skip=n`’  
‘`iseek=n`’  
<span id="index-skip"></span> <span id="index-iseek"></span>

Skip `n` ‘`ibs`’-byte blocks in the input file before copying. If `n`
ends in the letter ‘`B`’, interpret `n` as a byte count rather than a
block count. (‘`B`’ and the ‘`iseek=`’ spelling are GNU extensions to
POSIX.)

‘`seek=n`’  
‘`oseek=n`’  
<span id="index-seek"></span> <span id="index-oseek"></span>

Skip `n` ‘`obs`’-byte blocks in the output file before truncating or
copying. If `n` ends in the letter ‘`B`’, interpret `n` as a byte count
rather than a block count. (‘`B`’ and the ‘`oseek=`’ spelling are GNU
extensions to POSIX.)

‘`count=n`’  
<span id="index-count"></span>

Copy `n` ‘`ibs`’-byte blocks from the input file, instead of everything
until the end of the file. If `n` ends in the letter ‘`B`’, interpret
`n` as a byte count rather than a block count; this is a GNU extension
to POSIX. If short reads occur, as could be the case when reading from a
pipe for example, ‘`iflag=fullblock`’ ensures that ‘`count=`’ counts
complete input blocks rather than input read operations. As an extension
to POSIX, ‘`count=0`’ copies zero blocks instead of copying all blocks.

‘`status=level`’  
<span id="index-status"></span>

Specify the amount of information printed. If this operand is given
multiple times, the last one takes precedence. The `level` value can be
one of the following:

‘`none`’  
<span id="index-none-dd-status_003d"></span>

Do not print any informational or warning messages to standard error.
Error messages are output as normal.

‘`noxfer`’  
<span id="index-noxfer-dd-status_003d"></span>

Do not print the final transfer rate and volume statistics that normally
make up the last status line.

‘`progress`’  
<span id="index-progress-dd-status_003d"></span>

Print the transfer rate and volume statistics on standard error, when
processing each input block. Statistics are output on a single line at
most once every second, but updates can be delayed when waiting on I/O.

Transfer information is normally output to standard error upon receipt
of the ‘`INFO`’ signal or when `dd` exits, and defaults to the following
form in the C locale:

<div class="example">

``` example
7287+1 records in
116608+0 records out
59703296 bytes (60 MB, 57 MiB) copied, 0.0427974 s, 1.4 GB/s
```

</div>

The notation ‘`w+p`’ stands for `w` whole blocks and `p` partial blocks.
A partial block occurs when a read or write operation succeeds but
transfers less data than the block size. An additional line like
‘`1 truncated record`’ or ‘`10 truncated records`’ is output after the
‘`records out`’ line if ‘`conv=block`’ processing truncated one or more
input records.

The ‘`status=`’ operand is a GNU extension to POSIX.

‘`conv=conversion[,conversion]…`’  
<span id="index-conv"></span>

Convert the file as specified by the `conversion` argument(s). (No
spaces around any comma(s).)

Conversions:

‘`ascii`’  
<span id="index-ascii_002c-converting-to"></span>

Convert EBCDIC to ASCII, using the conversion table specified by POSIX.
This provides a 1:1 translation for all 256 bytes. This implies
‘`conv=unblock`’; input is converted to ASCII before trailing spaces are
deleted.

‘`ebcdic`’  
<span id="index-ebcdic_002c-converting-to"></span>

Convert ASCII to EBCDIC. This is the inverse of the ‘`ascii`’
conversion. This implies ‘`conv=block`’; trailing spaces are added
before being converted to EBCDIC.

‘`ibm`’  
<span id="index-alternate-ebcdic_002c-converting-to"></span>

This acts like ‘`conv=ebcdic`’, except it uses the alternate conversion
table specified by POSIX. This is not a 1:1 translation, but reflects
common historical practice for ‘`~`’, ‘`[`’, and ‘`]`’.

The ‘`ascii`’, ‘`ebcdic`’, and ‘`ibm`’ conversions are mutually
exclusive. If you use any of these conversions, you should also use the
‘`cbs=`’ operand.

‘`block`’  
<span id="index-block-_0028space_002dpadding_0029"></span>

For each line in the input, output ‘`cbs`’ bytes, replacing the input
newline with a space and truncating or padding input lines with spaces
as necessary.

‘`unblock`’  
<span id="index-unblock"></span>

Remove any trailing spaces in each ‘`cbs`’-sized input block, and append
a newline.

The ‘`block`’ and ‘`unblock`’ conversions are mutually exclusive. If you
use either of these conversions, you should also use the ‘`cbs=`’
operand.

‘`lcase`’  
<span id="index-lcase_002c-converting-to"></span>

Change uppercase letters to lowercase.

‘`ucase`’  
<span id="index-ucase_002c-converting-to"></span>

Change lowercase letters to uppercase.

The ‘`lcase`’ and ‘`ucase`’ conversions are mutually exclusive.

‘`sparse`’  
<span id="index-sparse"></span>

Try to seek rather than write NUL output blocks. On a file system that
supports sparse files, this will create sparse output when extending the
output file. Be careful when using this conversion in conjunction with
‘`conv=notrunc`’ or ‘`oflag=append`’. With ‘`conv=notrunc`’, existing
data in the output file corresponding to NUL blocks from the input, will
be untouched. With ‘`oflag=append`’ the seeks performed will be
ineffective. Similarly, when the output is a device rather than a file,
NUL input blocks are not copied, and therefore this conversion is most
useful with virtual or pre zeroed devices.

The ‘`sparse`’ conversion is a GNU extension to POSIX.

‘`swab`’  
<span id="index-swab-_0028byte_002dswapping_0029"></span> <span
id="index-byte_002dswapping-1"></span>

Swap every pair of input bytes.

‘`sync`’  
<span id="index-sync-_0028padding-with-ASCII-NULs_0029"></span>

Pad every input block to size of ‘`ibs`’ with trailing zero bytes. When
used with ‘`block`’ or ‘`unblock`’, pad with spaces instead of zero
bytes.

The following “conversions” are really file flags and don’t affect
internal processing:

‘`excl`’  
<span id="index-excl"></span> <span
id="index-creating-output-file_002c-requiring"></span>

Fail if the output file already exists; `dd` must create the output file
itself.

‘`nocreat`’  
<span id="index-nocreat"></span> <span
id="index-creating-output-file_002c-avoiding"></span>

Do not create the output file; the output file must already exist.

The ‘`excl`’ and ‘`nocreat`’ conversions are mutually exclusive, and are
GNU extensions to POSIX.

‘`notrunc`’  
<span id="index-notrunc"></span> <span
id="index-truncating-output-file_002c-avoiding"></span>

Do not truncate the output file.

‘`noerror`’  
<span id="index-noerror"></span> <span
id="index-read-errors_002c-ignoring"></span>

Continue after read errors.

‘`fdatasync`’  
<span id="index-fdatasync"></span> <span
id="index-synchronized-data-writes_002c-before-finishing"></span>

Synchronize output data just before finishing, even if there were write
errors. This forces a physical write of output data. This conversion is
a GNU extension to POSIX.

‘`fsync`’  
<span id="index-fsync"></span> <span
id="index-synchronized-data-and-metadata-writes_002c-before-finishing"></span>

Synchronize output data and metadata just before finishing, even if
there were write errors. This forces a physical write of output data and
metadata. This conversion is a GNU extension to POSIX.

‘`iflag=flag[,flag]…`’  
<span id="index-iflag"></span>

Access the input file using the flags specified by the `flag`
argument(s). (No spaces around any comma(s).)

‘`oflag=flag[,flag]…`’  
<span id="index-oflag"></span>

Access the output file using the flags specified by the `flag`
argument(s). (No spaces around any comma(s).)

Here are the flags.

‘`append`’  
<span id="index-append"></span> <span
id="index-appending-to-the-output-file"></span>

Write in append mode, so that even if some other process is writing to
this file, every `dd` write will append to the current contents of the
file. This flag makes sense only for output. If you combine this flag
with the ‘`of=file`’ operand, you should also specify ‘`conv=notrunc`’
unless you want the output file to be truncated before being appended
to.

‘`cio`’  
<span id="index-cio"></span> <span id="index-concurrent-I_002fO"></span>

Use concurrent I/O mode for data. This mode performs direct I/O and
drops the POSIX requirement to serialize all I/O to the same file. A
file cannot be opened in CIO mode and with a standard open at the same
time.

‘`direct`’  
<span id="index-direct"></span> <span id="index-direct-I_002fO"></span>

Use direct I/O for data, avoiding the buffer cache. Note that the kernel
may impose restrictions on read or write buffer sizes. For example, with
an ext4 destination file system and a Linux-based kernel, using
‘`oflag=direct`’ will cause writes to fail with `EINVAL` if the output
buffer size is not a multiple of 512.

‘`directory`’  
<span id="index-directory"></span> <span
id="index-directory-I_002fO"></span>

Fail unless the file is a directory. Most operating systems do not allow
I/O to a directory, so this flag has limited utility.

‘`dsync`’  
<span id="index-dsync"></span> <span
id="index-synchronized-data-reads"></span>

Use synchronized I/O for data. For the output file, this forces a
physical write of output data on each write. For the input file, this
flag can matter when reading from a remote file that has been written to
synchronously by some other process. Metadata (e.g., last-access and
last-modified time) is not necessarily synchronized.

‘`sync`’  
<span id="index-sync"></span> <span
id="index-synchronized-data-and-metadata-I_002fO"></span>

Use synchronized I/O for both data and metadata.

‘`nocache`’  
<span id="index-nocache"></span> <span
id="index-discarding-file-cache"></span>

Request to discard the system data cache for a file. When count=0 all
cached data for the file is specified, otherwise the cache is dropped
for the processed portion of the file. Also when count=0, failure to
discard the cache is diagnosed and reflected in the exit status.

Note data that is not already persisted to storage will not be discarded
from cache, so note the use of the ‘`sync`’ conversions in the examples
below, which are used to maximize the effectiveness of the ‘`nocache`’
flag.

Here are some usage examples:

<div class="example">

``` example
# Advise to drop cache for whole file
dd if=ifile iflag=nocache count=0

# Ensure drop cache for the whole file
dd of=ofile oflag=nocache conv=notrunc,fdatasync count=0

# Advise to drop cache for part of file
# Note the kernel will only consider complete and
# already persisted pages.
dd if=ifile iflag=nocache skip=10 count=10 of=/dev/null

# Stream data using just the read-ahead cache.
# See also the ‘direct’ flag.
dd if=ifile of=ofile iflag=nocache oflag=nocache,sync
```

</div>

‘`nonblock`’  
<span id="index-nonblock"></span> <span
id="index-nonblocking-I_002fO"></span>

Use non-blocking I/O.

‘`noatime`’  
<span id="index-noatime"></span> <span
id="index-access-timestamp"></span>

Do not update the file’s access timestamp. See [File
timestamps](#File-timestamps). Some older file systems silently ignore
this flag, so it is a good idea to test it on your files before relying
on it.

‘`noctty`’  
<span id="index-noctty"></span> <span
id="index-controlling-terminal"></span>

Do not assign the file to be a controlling terminal for `dd`. This has
no effect when the file is not a terminal. On many hosts (e.g.,
GNU/Linux hosts), this flag has no effect at all.

‘`nofollow`’  
<span id="index-nofollow"></span> <span
id="index-symbolic-links_002c-following"></span>

Do not follow symbolic links.

‘`nolinks`’  
<span id="index-nolinks"></span> <span id="index-hard-links"></span>

Fail if the file has multiple hard links.

‘`binary`’  
<span id="index-binary"></span> <span id="index-binary-I_002fO"></span>

Use binary I/O. This flag has an effect only on nonstandard platforms
that distinguish binary from text I/O.

‘`text`’  
<span id="index-text"></span> <span id="index-text-I_002fO"></span>

Use text I/O. Like ‘`binary`’, this flag has no effect on standard
platforms.

‘`fullblock`’  
<span id="index-fullblock"></span>

Accumulate full blocks from input. The `read` system call may return
early if a full block is not available. When that happens, continue
calling `read` to fill the remainder of the block. This flag can be used
only with `iflag`. This flag is useful with pipes for example as they
may return short reads. In that case, this flag is needed to ensure that
a ‘`count=`’ argument is interpreted as a block count rather than a
count of read operations.

These flags are all GNU extensions to POSIX. They are not supported on
all systems, and ‘`dd`’ rejects attempts to use them when they are not
supported. When reading from standard input or writing to standard
output, the ‘`nofollow`’ and ‘`noctty`’ flags should not be specified,
and the other flags (e.g., ‘`nonblock`’) can affect how other processes
behave with the affected file descriptors, even after `dd` exits.

The behavior of `dd` is unspecified if operands other than ‘`conv=`’,
‘`iflag=`’, ‘`oflag=`’, and ‘`status=`’ are specified more than once.

<span id="index-multipliers-after-numbers"></span>

The numeric-valued strings above (`n` and `bytes`) are unsigned decimal
integers that can be followed by a multiplier: ‘`b`’=512, ‘`c`’=1,
‘`w`’=2, ‘`xm`’=`m`, or any of the standard block size suffixes like
‘`k`’=1024 (see [Block size](#Block-size)). These multipliers are GNU
extensions to POSIX, except that POSIX allows `bytes` to be followed by
‘`k`’, ‘`b`’, and ‘`xm`’. Block sizes (i.e., specified by `bytes`
strings) must be nonzero.

Any block size you specify via ‘`bs=`’, ‘`ibs=`’, ‘`obs=`’, ‘`cbs=`’
should not be too large—values larger than a few megabytes are generally
wasteful or (as in the gigabyte..exabyte case) downright
counterproductive or error-inducing.

To process data with offset or size that is not a multiple of the I/O
block size, you can use a numeric string `n` that ends in the letter
‘`B`’. For example, the following shell commands copy data in 1 MiB
blocks between a flash drive and a tape, but do not save or restore a
512-byte area at the start of the flash drive:

<div class="example">

``` example
flash=/dev/sda
tape=/dev/st0

# Copy all but the initial 512 bytes from flash to tape.
dd if=$flash iseek=512B bs=1MiB of=$tape

# Copy from tape back to flash, leaving initial 512 bytes alone.
dd if=$tape bs=1MiB of=$flash oseek=512B
```

</div>

<span id="index-ddrescue"></span> <span
id="index-storage-devices_002c-failing"></span>

For failing storage devices, other tools come with a great variety of
extra functionality to ease the saving of as much data as possible
before the device finally dies, e.g. [GNU
`ddrescue`](https://www.gnu.org/software/ddrescue/). However, in some
cases such a tool is not available or the administrator feels more
comfortable with the handling of `dd`. As a simple rescue method, call
`dd` as shown in the following example: the operand
‘`conv=noerror,sync`’ is used to continue after read errors and to pad
out bad reads with NULs, while ‘`iflag=fullblock`’ caters for short
reads (which traditionally never occur on flash or similar devices):

<div class="example">

``` example
# Rescue data from an (unmounted!) partition of a failing device.
dd conv=noerror,sync iflag=fullblock </dev/sda1 > /mnt/rescue.img
```

</div>

Sending an ‘`INFO`’ signal (or ‘`USR1`’ signal where that is
unavailable) to a running `dd` process makes it print I/O statistics to
standard error and then resume copying. In the example below, `dd` is
run in the background to copy 5GB of data. The `kill` command makes it
output intermediate I/O statistics, and when `dd` completes normally or
is killed by the `SIGINT` signal, it outputs the final statistics.

<div class="example">

``` example
# Ignore the signal so we never inadvertently terminate the dd child.
# Note this is not needed when SIGINFO is available.
trap '' USR1

# Run dd with the fullblock iflag to avoid short reads
# which can be triggered by reception of signals.
dd iflag=fullblock if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null count=5000000 bs=1000 & pid=$!

# Output stats every second.
while kill -s USR1 $pid 2>/dev/null; do sleep 1; done
```

</div>

The above script will output in the following format:

<div class="example">

``` example
3441325+0 records in
3441325+0 records out
3441325000 bytes (3.4 GB, 3.2 GiB) copied, 1.00036 s, 3.4 GB/s
5000000+0 records in
5000000+0 records out
5000000000 bytes (5.0 GB, 4.7 GiB) copied, 1.44433 s, 3.5 GB/s
```

</div>

The ‘`status=progress`’ operand periodically updates the last line of
the transfer statistics above.

<span id="index-POSIXLY_005fCORRECT-5"></span>

On systems lacking the ‘`INFO`’ signal `dd` responds to the ‘`USR1`’
signal instead, unless the `POSIXLY_CORRECT` environment variable is
set.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

### 11.3 `install`: Copy files and set attributes

<span id="index-install"></span> <span
id="index-copying-files-and-setting-attributes"></span>

`install` copies files while setting their file mode bits and, if
possible, their owner and group. Synopses:

<div class="example">

``` example
install [option]… [-T] source dest
install [option]… source… directory
install [option]… -t directory source…
install [option]… -d directory…
```

</div>

-   If two file names are given, `install` copies the first file to the
    second.
-   If the `--target-directory` (`-t`) option is given, or failing that
    if the last file is a directory and the `--no-target-directory`
    (`-T`) option is not given, `install` copies each `source` file to
    the specified directory, using the `source`s’ names.
-   If the `--directory` (`-d`) option is given, `install` creates each
    `directory` and any missing parent directories. Parent directories
    are created with mode ‘`u=rwx,go=rx`’ (755), regardless of the `-m`
    option or the current umask. See [Directory Setuid and
    Setgid](#Directory-Setuid-and-Setgid), for how the set-user-ID and
    set-group-ID bits of parent directories are inherited.

<span id="index-Makefiles_002c-installing-programs-in"></span>

`install` is similar to `cp`, but allows you to control the attributes
of destination files. It is typically used in Makefiles to copy programs
into their destination directories. It refuses to copy files onto
themselves.

<span id="index-extended-attributes_002c-xattr"></span>

`install` never preserves extended attributes (xattr).

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`-b`’  
‘`--backup[=method]`’  
<span id="index-_002db-15"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dbackup-2"></span> <span
id="index-VERSION_005fCONTROL-2"></span> <span
id="index-backups_002c-making-2"></span>

See [Backup options](#Backup-options). Make a backup of each file that
would otherwise be overwritten or removed.

‘`-C`’  
‘`--compare`’  
<span id="index-_002dC-3"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dcompare"></span>

Compare content of source and destination files, and if there would be
no change to the destination content, owner, group, permissions, and
possibly SELinux context, then do not modify the destination at all.
Note this option is best used in conjunction with `--user`, `--group`
and `--mode` options, lest `install` incorrectly determines the default
attributes that installed files would have (as it doesn’t consider
setgid directories and POSIX default ACLs for example). This could
result in redundant copies or attributes that are not reset to the
correct defaults.

‘`-c`’  
<span id="index-_002dc-14"></span>

Ignored; for compatibility with old Unix versions of `install`.

‘`-D`’  
<span id="index-_002dD-2"></span>

Create any missing parent directories of `dest`, then copy `source` to
`dest`. Explicitly specifying the `--target-directory=dir` will
similarly ensure the presence of that hierarchy before copying `source`
arguments.

‘`-d`’  
‘`--directory`’  
<span id="index-_002dd-12"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002ddirectory-1"></span> <span
id="index-directories_002c-creating-with-given-attributes"></span> <span
id="index-parent-directories_002c-creating-missing"></span> <span
id="index-leading-directories_002c-creating-missing"></span>

Create any missing parent directories, giving them the default
attributes. Then create each given directory, setting their owner, group
and mode as given on the command line or to the defaults.

‘`-g group`’  
‘`--group=group`’  
<span id="index-_002dg-4"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dgroup-1"></span> <span
id="index-group-ownership-of-installed-files_002c-setting"></span>

Set the group ownership of installed files or directories to `group`.
The default is the process’s current group. `group` may be either a
group name or a numeric group ID.

‘`-m mode`’  
‘`--mode=mode`’  
<span id="index-_002dm-4"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dmode"></span> <span
id="index-permissions-of-installed-files_002c-setting"></span>

Set the file mode bits for the installed file or directory to `mode`,
which can be either an octal number, or a symbolic mode as in `chmod`,
with ‘`a=`’ (no access allowed to anyone) as the point of departure (see
[File permissions](#File-permissions)). The default mode is
‘`u=rwx,go=rx,a-s`’—read, write, and execute for the owner, read and
execute for group and other, and with set-user-ID and set-group-ID
disabled. This default is not quite the same as ‘`755`’, since it
disables instead of preserving set-user-ID and set-group-ID on
directories. See [Directory Setuid and
Setgid](#Directory-Setuid-and-Setgid).

‘`-o owner`’  
‘`--owner=owner`’  
<span id="index-_002do-6"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002downer"></span> <span
id="index-ownership-of-installed-files_002c-setting"></span> <span
id="index-appropriate-privileges"></span> <span
id="index-root-as-default-owner"></span>

If `install` has appropriate privileges (is run as root), set the
ownership of installed files or directories to `owner`. The default is
`root`. `owner` may be either a user name or a numeric user ID.

‘`--preserve-context`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dpreserve_002dcontext"></span> <span
id="index-SELinux-1"></span> <span id="index-security-context-2"></span>

Preserve the SELinux security context of files and directories. Failure
to preserve the context in all of the files or directories will result
in an exit status of 1. If SELinux is disabled then print a warning and
ignore the option.

‘`-p`’  
‘`--preserve-timestamps`’  
<span id="index-_002dp-4"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dpreserve_002dtimestamps"></span> <span
id="index-timestamps-of-installed-files_002c-preserving"></span>

Set the time of last access and the time of last modification of each
installed file to match those of each corresponding original file. When
a file is installed without this option, its last access and last
modification timestamps are both set to the time of installation. This
option is useful if you want to use the last modification timestamps of
installed files to keep track of when they were last built as opposed to
when they were last installed.

‘`-s`’  
‘`--strip`’  
<span id="index-_002ds-17"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dstrip"></span> <span
id="index-symbol-table-information_002c-stripping"></span> <span
id="index-stripping-symbol-table-information"></span>

Strip the symbol tables from installed binary executables.

‘`--strip-program=program`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dstrip_002dprogram"></span> <span
id="index-symbol-table-information_002c-stripping_002c-program"></span>

Program used to strip binaries.

‘`-S suffix`’  
‘`--suffix=suffix`’  
<span id="index-_002dS-7"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dsuffix-2"></span>

Append `suffix` to each backup file made with `-b`. See [Backup
options](#Backup-options).

‘`-t directory`’  
‘`--target-directory=directory`’  
<span id="index-_002dt-12"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dtarget_002ddirectory-2"></span> <span
id="index-target-directory-5"></span> <span
id="index-destination-directory-4"></span>

Specify the destination `directory`. See [Target
directory](#Target-directory). Also specifying the `-D` option will
ensure the directory is present.

‘`-T`’  
‘`--no-target-directory`’  
<span id="index-_002dT-6"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dno_002dtarget_002ddirectory-2"></span> <span
id="index-target-directory-6"></span> <span
id="index-destination-directory-5"></span>

Do not treat the last operand specially when it is a directory or a
symbolic link to a directory. See [Target directory](#Target-directory).

‘`-v`’  
‘`--verbose`’  
<span id="index-_002dv-8"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dverbose-4"></span>

Print the name of each file before copying it.

‘`-Z`’  
‘`--context[=context]`’

id="index-SELinux_002c-setting_002frestoring-security-context-1"></span>
<span id="index-security-context-3"></span>

Without a specified `context`, adjust the SELinux security context
according to the system default type for destination files, similarly to
the `restorecon` command. The long form of this option with a specific
context specified, will set the context for newly created files only.
With a specified context, if both SELinux and SMACK are disabled, a
warning is issued. This option is mutually exclusive with the
`--preserve-context` option.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

<span id="mv_003a-Move-_0028rename_0029-files"></span>

### 11.4 `mv`: Move (rename) files

<span id="index-mv"></span>

`mv` moves or renames files (or directories). Synopses:

<div class="example">

``` example
mv [option]… [-T] source dest
mv [option]… source… directory
mv [option]… -t directory source…
```

</div>

-   If two file names are given, `mv` moves the first file to the
    second.
-   If the `--target-directory` (`-t`) option is given, or failing that
    if the last file is a directory and the `--no-target-directory`
    (`-T`) option is not given, `mv` moves each `source` file to the
    specified directory, using the `source`s’ names.

`mv` can move any type of file from one file system to another. Prior to
version `4.0` of the fileutils, `mv` could move only regular files
between file systems. For example, now `mv` can move an entire directory
hierarchy including special device files from one partition to another.
It first uses some of the same code that’s used by `cp -a` to copy the
requested directories and files, then (assuming the copy succeeded) it
removes the originals. If the copy fails, then the part that was copied
to the destination partition is removed. If you were to copy three
directories from one partition to another and the copy of the first
directory succeeded, but the second didn’t, the first would be left on
the destination partition and the second and third would be left on the
original partition.

<span id="index-extended-attributes_002c-xattr-1"></span>

`mv` always tries to copy extended attributes (xattr), which may include
SELinux context, ACLs or Capabilities. Upon failure all but
‘`Operation not supported`’ warnings are output.

<span id="index-prompting_002c-and-mv"></span>

If a destination file exists but is normally unwritable, standard input
is a terminal, and the `-f` or `--force` option is not given, `mv`
prompts the user for whether to replace the file. (You might own the
file, or have write permission on its directory.) If the response is not
affirmative, the file is skipped.

*Warning*: Avoid specifying a source name with a trailing slash, when it
might be a symlink to a directory. Otherwise, `mv` may do something very
surprising, since its behavior depends on the underlying rename system
call. On a system with a modern Linux-based kernel, it fails with
`errno=ENOTDIR`. However, on other systems (at least FreeBSD 6.1 and
Solaris 10) it silently renames not the symlink but rather the directory
referenced by the symlink. See [Trailing slashes](#Trailing-slashes).

*Note*: `mv` will only replace empty directories in the destination.
Conflicting populated directories are skipped with a diagnostic.

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`-b`’  
‘`--backup[=method]`’  
<span id="index-_002db-16"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dbackup-3"></span> <span
id="index-VERSION_005fCONTROL-3"></span> <span
id="index-backups_002c-making-3"></span>

See [Backup options](#Backup-options). Make a backup of each file that
would otherwise be overwritten or removed.

‘`-f`’  
‘`--force`’  
<span id="index-_002df-11"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dforce-1"></span> <span
id="index-prompts_002c-omitting"></span>

Do not prompt the user before removing a destination file. If you
specify more than one of the `-i`, `-f`, `-n` options, only the final
one takes effect.

‘`-i`’  
‘`--interactive`’  
<span id="index-_002di-12"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dinteractive-1"></span> <span
id="index-prompts_002c-forcing"></span>

Prompt whether to overwrite each existing destination file, regardless
of its permissions. If the response is not affirmative, the file is
skipped. If you specify more than one of the `-i`, `-f`, `-n` options,
only the final one takes effect.

‘`-n`’  
‘`--no-clobber`’  
<span id="index-_002dn-12"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dno_002dclobber-1"></span> <span
id="index-prompts_002c-omitting-1"></span>

Do not overwrite an existing file; silently do nothing instead. If you
specify more than one of the `-i`, `-f`, `-n` options, only the final
one takes effect. This option is mutually exclusive with `-b` or
`--backup` option.

‘`-u`’  
‘`--update`’  
<span id="index-_002du-7"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dupdate-1"></span> <span
id="index-newer-files_002c-moving-only"></span>

Do not move a non-directory that has an existing destination with the
same or newer modification timestamp. If the move is across file system
boundaries, the comparison is to the source timestamp truncated to the
resolutions of the destination file system and of the system calls used
to update timestamps; this avoids duplicate work if several ‘`mv -u`’
commands are executed with the same source and destination. This option
is ignored if the `-n` or `--no-clobber` option is also specified.

‘`-v`’  
‘`--verbose`’  
<span id="index-_002dv-9"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dverbose-5"></span>

Print the name of each file before moving it.

‘`--strip-trailing-slashes`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dstrip_002dtrailing_002dslashes-1"></span>
<span id="index-stripping-trailing-slashes-1"></span>

Remove any trailing slashes from each `source` argument. See [Trailing
slashes](#Trailing-slashes).

‘`-S suffix`’  
‘`--suffix=suffix`’  
<span id="index-_002dS-8"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dsuffix-3"></span>

Append `suffix` to each backup file made with `-b`. See [Backup
options](#Backup-options).

‘`-t directory`’  
‘`--target-directory=directory`’  
<span id="index-_002dt-13"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dtarget_002ddirectory-3"></span> <span
id="index-target-directory-7"></span> <span
id="index-destination-directory-6"></span>

Specify the destination `directory`. See [Target
directory](#Target-directory).

‘`-T`’  
‘`--no-target-directory`’  
<span id="index-_002dT-7"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dno_002dtarget_002ddirectory-3"></span> <span
id="index-target-directory-8"></span> <span
id="index-destination-directory-7"></span>

Do not treat the last operand specially when it is a directory or a
symbolic link to a directory. See [Target directory](#Target-directory).

‘`-Z`’  
‘`--context`’  
<span id="index-_002dZ-3"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dcontext-3"></span> <span
id="index-SELinux_002c-restoring-security-context"></span> <span
id="index-security-context-4"></span>

This option functions similarly to the `restorecon` command, by
adjusting the SELinux security context according to the system default
type for destination files and each created directory.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

### 11.5 `rm`: Remove files or directories

<span id="index-rm"></span> <span
id="index-removing-files-or-directories"></span>

`rm` removes each given `file`. By default, it does not remove
directories. Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
rm [option]… [file]…
```

</div>

<span id="index-prompting_002c-and-rm"></span>

If the `-I` or `--interactive=once` option is given, and there are more
than three files or the `-r`, `-R`, or `--recursive` are given, then
`rm` prompts the user for whether to proceed with the entire operation.
If the response is not affirmative, the entire command is aborted.

Otherwise, if a file is unwritable, standard input is a terminal, and
the `-f` or `--force` option is not given, or the `-i` or
`--interactive=always` option *is* given, `rm` prompts the user for
whether to remove the file. If the response is not affirmative, the file
is skipped.

Any attempt to remove a file whose last file name component is `.` or
`..` is rejected without any prompting, as mandated by POSIX.

*Warning*: If you use `rm` to remove a file, it is usually possible to
recover the contents of that file. If you want more assurance that the
contents are unrecoverable, consider using `shred`.

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`-d`’  
‘`--dir`’  
<span id="index-_002dd-13"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002ddir"></span> <span
id="index-directories_002c-removing"></span>

Remove the listed directories if they are empty.

‘`-f`’  
‘`--force`’  
<span id="index-_002df-12"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dforce-2"></span>

Ignore nonexistent files and missing operands, and never prompt the
user. Ignore any previous `--interactive` (`-i`) option.

‘`-i`’  
<span id="index-_002di-13"></span>

Prompt whether to remove each file. If the response is not affirmative,
the file is skipped. Ignore any previous `--force` (`-f`) option.
Equivalent to `--interactive=always`.

‘`-I`’  
<span id="index-_002dI-1"></span>

Prompt once whether to proceed with the command, if more than three
files are named or if a recursive removal is requested. Ignore any
previous `--force` (`-f`) option. Equivalent to `--interactive=once`.

‘`--interactive [=when]`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dinteractive-2"></span>

Specify when to issue an interactive prompt. `when` may be omitted, or
one of:

-   never <span id="index-never-interactive-option"></span> - Do not
    prompt at all.
-   once <span id="index-once-interactive-option"></span> - Prompt once
    if more than three files are named or if a recursive removal is
    requested. Equivalent to `-I`.
-   always <span id="index-always-interactive-option"></span> - Prompt
    for every file being removed. Equivalent to `-i`.

`--interactive` with no `when` is equivalent to `--interactive=always`.

‘`--one-file-system`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002done_002dfile_002dsystem-1"></span> <span
id="index-one-file-system_002c-restricting-rm-to"></span>

When removing a hierarchy recursively, skip any directory that is on a
file system different from that of the corresponding command line
argument. <span id="index-bind-mount"></span> This option is useful when
removing a build “chroot” hierarchy, which normally contains no valuable
data. However, it is not uncommon to bind-mount `/home` into such a
hierarchy, to make it easier to use one’s start-up file. The catch is
that it’s easy to forget to unmount `/home`. Then, when you use `rm -rf`
to remove your normally throw-away chroot, that command will remove
everything under `/home`, too. Use the `--one-file-system` option, and
it will warn about and skip directories on other file systems. Of
course, this will not save your `/home` if it and your chroot happen to
be on the same file system. See also `--preserve-root=all` to protect
command line arguments themselves.

‘`--preserve-root [=all]`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dpreserve_002droot"></span> <span
id="index-root-directory_002c-disallow-recursive-destruction"></span>

Fail upon any attempt to remove the root directory, `/`, when used with
the `--recursive` option. This is the default behavior. See [Treating /
specially](#Treating-_002f-specially). When ‘`all`’ is specified, reject
any command line argument that is not on the same file system as its
parent.

‘`--no-preserve-root`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dno_002dpreserve_002droot"></span> <span
id="index-root-directory_002c-allow-recursive-destruction"></span>

Do not treat `/` specially when removing recursively. This option is not
recommended unless you really want to remove all the files on your
computer. See [Treating / specially](#Treating-_002f-specially).

‘`-r`’  
‘`-R`’  
‘`--recursive`’  
<span id="index-_002dr-8"></span> <span id="index-_002dR-4"></span>
<span id="index-_002d_002drecursive-2"></span> <span
id="index-directories_002c-removing-_0028recursively_0029"></span>

Remove the listed directories and their contents recursively.

‘`-v`’  
‘`--verbose`’  
<span id="index-_002dv-10"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dverbose-6"></span>

Print the name of each file before removing it.

<span id="index-files-beginning-with-_002d_002c-removing"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002c-removing-files-beginning-with"></span>

One common question is how to remove files whose names begin with a
‘`-`’. GNU `rm`, like every program that uses the `getopt` function to
parse its arguments, lets you use the ‘`--`’ option to indicate that all
following arguments are non-options. To remove a file called `-f` in the
current directory, you could type either:

<div class="example">

``` example
rm -- -f
```

</div>

or:

<div class="example">

``` example
rm ./-f
```

</div>

<span id="index-_002d-and-Unix-rm"></span>

The Unix `rm` program’s use of a single ‘`-`’ for this purpose predates
the development of the `getopt` standard syntax.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

### 11.6 `shred`: Remove files more securely

<span id="index-shred"></span> <span
id="index-data_002c-erasing"></span> <span
id="index-erasing-data"></span>

`shred` overwrites devices or files, to help prevent even extensive
forensics from recovering the data.

Ordinarily when you remove a file (see [rm invocation](#rm-invocation)),
its data and metadata are not actually destroyed. Only the file’s
directory entry is removed, and the file’s storage is reclaimed only
when no process has the file open and no other directory entry links to
the file. And even if file’s data and metadata’s storage space is freed
for further reuse, there are undelete utilities that will attempt to
reconstruct the file from the data in freed storage, and that can bring
the file back if the storage was not rewritten.

On a busy system with a nearly-full device, space can get reused in a
few seconds. But there is no way to know for sure. And although the
undelete utilities and already-existing processes require insider or
superuser access, you may be wary of the superuser, of processes running
on your behalf, or of attackers that can physically access the storage
device. So if you have sensitive data, you may want to be sure that
recovery is not possible by plausible attacks like these.

The best way to remove something irretrievably is to destroy the media
it’s on with acid, melt it down, or the like. For cheap removable media
this is often the preferred method. However, some storage devices are
expensive or are harder to destroy, so the `shred` utility tries to
achieve a similar effect non-destructively, by overwriting the file with
non-sensitive data.

**Please note** that `shred` relies on a crucial assumption: that the
file system and hardware overwrite data in place. Although this is
common and is the traditional way to do things, but many modern file
system designs do not satisfy this assumption. Exceptions include:

-   Log-structured or journaled file systems, such as ext3/ext4 (in
    `data=journal` mode), Btrfs, NTFS, ReiserFS, XFS, ZFS, file systems
    supplied with AIX and Solaris, etc., when they are configured to
    journal data.
-   File systems that write redundant data and carry on even if some
    writes fail, such as RAID-based file systems.
-   File systems that make snapshots, such as Network Appliance’s NFS
    server.
-   File systems that cache in temporary locations, such as NFS version
    3 clients.
-   Compressed file systems.

For ext3 and ext4 file systems, `shred` is less effective when the file
system is in `data=journal` mode, which journals file data in addition
to just metadata. In both the `data=ordered` (default) and
`data=writeback` modes, `shred` works as usual. The ext3/ext4 journaling
modes can be changed by adding the `data=something` option to the mount
options for a particular file system in the `/etc/fstab` file, as
documented in the `mount` man page (‘`man mount`’). Alternatively, if
you know how large the journal is, you can shred the journal by
shredding enough file data so that the journal cycles around and fills
up with shredded data.

If you are not sure how your file system operates, then you should
assume that it does not overwrite data in place, which means `shred`
cannot reliably operate on regular files in your file system.

Generally speaking, it is more reliable to shred a device than a file,
since this bypasses file system design issues mentioned above. However,
devices are also problematic for shredding, for reasons such as the
following:

-   Solid-state storage devices (SSDs) typically do wear leveling to
    prolong service life, and this means writes are distributed to other
    blocks by the hardware, so “overwritten” data blocks are still
    present in the underlying device.

-   Most storage devices map out bad blocks invisibly to the
    application; if the bad blocks contain sensitive data, `shred` won’t
    be able to destroy it.

-   With some obsolete storage technologies, it may be possible to take
    (say) a floppy disk back to a laboratory and use a lot of sensitive
    (and expensive) equipment to look for the faint “echoes” of the
    original data underneath the overwritten data. With these older
    technologies, if the file has been overwritten only once, it’s
    reputedly not even that hard. Luckily, this kind of data recovery
    has become difficult, and there is no public evidence that today’s
    higher-density storage devices can be analyzed in this way.

    The `shred` command can use many overwrite passes, with data
    patterns chosen to maximize the damage they do to the old data. By
    default the patterns are designed for best effect on hard drives
    using now-obsolete technology; for newer devices, a single pass
    should suffice. For more details, see the source code and Peter
    Gutmann’s paper [Secure Deletion of Data from Magnetic and
    Solid-State
    Memory](https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/secure_del.html),
    from the proceedings of the Sixth USENIX Security Symposium (San
    Jose, California, July 22–25, 1996).

`shred` makes no attempt to detect or report these problems, just as it
makes no attempt to do anything about backups. However, since it is more
reliable to shred devices than files, `shred` by default does not
deallocate or remove the output file. This default is more suitable for
devices, which typically cannot be deallocated and should not be
removed.

Finally, consider the risk of backups and mirrors. File system backups
and remote mirrors may contain copies of the file that cannot be
removed, and that will allow a shredded file to be recovered later. So
if you keep any data you may later want to destroy using `shred`, be
sure that it is not backed up or mirrored.

<div class="example">

``` example
shred [option]… file[…]
```

</div>

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`-f`’  
‘`--force`’  
<span id="index-_002df-13"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dforce-3"></span> <span
id="index-force-deletion"></span>

Override file permissions if necessary to allow overwriting.

‘`-n number`’  
‘`--iterations=number`’  
<span id="index-_002dn-number"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002diterations_003dnumber"></span> <span
id="index-iterations_002c-selecting-the-number-of"></span>

By default, `shred` uses 3 passes of overwrite. You can reduce this to
save time, or increase it if you think it’s appropriate. After 25 passes
all of the internal overwrite patterns will have been used at least
once.

‘`--random-source=file`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002drandom_002dsource-2"></span> <span
id="index-random-source-for-shredding"></span>

Use `file` as a source of random data used to overwrite and to choose
pass ordering. See [Random sources](#Random-sources).

‘`-s bytes`’  
‘`--size=bytes`’  
<span id="index-_002ds-bytes"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dsize_003dbytes"></span> <span
id="index-size-of-file-to-shred"></span>

Shred the first `bytes` bytes of the file. The default is to shred the
whole file. `bytes` can be followed by a size specification like ‘`K`’,
‘`M`’, or ‘`G`’ to specify a multiple. See [Block size](#Block-size).

‘`-u`’  
‘`--remove[=how]`’  
<span id="index-_002du-8"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dremove"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dremove_003dunlink"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dremove_003dwipe"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dremove_003dwipesync"></span> <span
id="index-removing-files-after-shredding"></span>

After shredding a file, deallocate it (if possible) and then remove it.
If a file has multiple links, only the named links will be removed.
Often the file name is less sensitive than the file data, in which case
the optional `how` parameter, supported with the long form option, gives
control of how to more efficiently remove each directory entry. The
‘`unlink`’ parameter will just use a standard unlink call, ‘`wipe`’ will
also first obfuscate bytes in the name, and ‘`wipesync`’ will also sync
each obfuscated byte in the name to the file system. Note ‘`wipesync`’
is the default method, but can be expensive, requiring a sync for every
character in every file. This can become significant with many files, or
is redundant if your file system provides synchronous metadata updates.

‘`-v`’  
‘`--verbose`’  
<span id="index-_002dv-11"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dverbose-7"></span>

Display to standard error all status updates as sterilization proceeds.

‘`-x`’  
‘`--exact`’  
<span id="index-_002dx-4"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dexact"></span>

By default, `shred` rounds the size of a regular file up to the next
multiple of the file system block size to fully erase the slack space in
the last block of the file. This space may contain portions of the
current system memory on some systems for example. Use `--exact` to
suppress that behavior. Thus, by default if you shred a 10-byte regular
file on a system with 512-byte blocks, the resulting file will be 512
bytes long. With this option, shred does not increase the apparent size
of the file.

‘`-z`’  
‘`--zero`’  
<span id="index-_002dz-11"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dzero-2"></span>

Normally, the last pass that `shred` writes is made up of random data.
If this would be conspicuous on your storage device (for example,
because it looks like encrypted data), or you just think it’s tidier,
the `--zero` option adds an additional overwrite pass with all zero
bits. This is in addition to the number of passes specified by the
`--iterations` option.

You might use the following command to erase the file system you created
on a USB flash drive. This command typically takes several minutes,
depending on the drive’s size and write speed. On modern storage devices
a single pass should be adequate, and will take one third the time of
the default three-pass approach.

<div class="example">

``` example
shred -v -n 1 /dev/sdd1
```

</div>

Similarly, to erase all data on a selected partition of your device, you
could give a command like the following.

<div class="example">

``` example
# 1 pass, write pseudo-random data; 3x faster than the default
shred -v -n1 /dev/sda5
```

</div>

To be on the safe side, use at least one pass that overwrites using
pseudo-random data. I.e., don’t be tempted to use ‘`-n0 --zero`’, in
case some device controller optimizes the process of writing blocks of
all zeros, and thereby does not clear all bytes in a block. Some SSDs
may do just that.

A `file` of ‘`-`’ denotes standard output. The intended use of this is
to shred a removed temporary file. For example:

<div class="example">

``` example
i=$(mktemp)
exec 3<>"$i"
rm -- "$i"
echo "Hello, world" >&3
shred - >&3
exec 3>-
```

</div>

However, the command ‘`shred - >file`’ does not shred the contents of
`file`, since the shell truncates `file` before invoking `shred`. Use
the command ‘`shred file`’ or (if using a Bourne-compatible shell) the
command ‘`shred - 1<>file`’ instead.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

## 12 Special file types

<span id="index-special-file-types"></span> <span
id="index-file-types_002c-special"></span>

This chapter describes commands which create special types of files (and
`rmdir`, which removes directories, one special file type).

<span id="index-special-file-types-1"></span> <span
id="index-file-types"></span>

Although Unix-like operating systems have markedly fewer special file
types than others, not *everything* can be treated only as the
undifferentiated byte stream of *normal files*. For example, when a file
is created or removed, the system must record this information, which it
does in a *directory*—a special type of file. Although you can read
directories as normal files, if you’re curious, in order for the system
to do its job it must impose a structure, a certain order, on the bytes
of the file. Thus it is a “special” type of file.

Besides directories, other special file types include named pipes
(FIFOs), symbolic links, sockets, and so-called *special files*.

<span id="link_003a-Make-a-hard-link-via-the-link-syscall"></span>

### 12.1 `link`: Make a hard link via the link syscall

<span id="index-link"></span> <span
id="index-links_002c-creating"></span> <span
id="index-hard-links_002c-creating"></span> <span
id="index-creating-links-_0028hard-only_0029"></span>

`link` creates a single hard link at a time. It is a minimalist
interface to the system-provided `link` function. See [Hard
Links](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_mono/libc.html#Hard-Links)
in The GNU C Library Reference Manual. It avoids the bells and whistles
of the more commonly-used `ln` command (see [ln
invocation](#ln-invocation)). Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
link filename linkname
```

</div>

`filename` must specify an existing file, and `linkname` must specify a
nonexistent entry in an existing directory. `link` simply calls
`link (filename, linkname)` to create the link.

On a GNU system, this command acts like
‘`ln --directory --no-target-directory filename linkname`’. However, the
`--directory` and `--no-target-directory` options are not specified by
POSIX, and the `link` command is more portable in practice.

If `filename` is a symbolic link, it is unspecified whether `linkname`
will be a hard link to the symbolic link or to the target of the
symbolic link. Use `ln -P` or `ln -L` to specify which behavior is
desired.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

<span id="ln_003a-Make-links-between-files"></span>

### 12.2 `ln`: Make links between files

<span id="index-ln"></span> <span
id="index-links_002c-creating-1"></span> <span
id="index-hard-links_002c-creating-1"></span> <span
id="index-symbolic-_0028soft_0029-links_002c-creating"></span> <span
id="index-creating-links-_0028hard-or-soft_0029"></span> <span
id="index-file-systems-and-hard-links"></span>

`ln` makes links between files. By default, it makes hard links; with
the `-s` option, it makes symbolic (or *soft*) links. Synopses:

<div class="example">

``` example
ln [option]… [-T] target linkname
ln [option]… target
ln [option]… target… directory
ln [option]… -t directory target…
```

</div>

-   If two file names are given, `ln` creates a link to the first file
    from the second.
-   If one `target` is given, `ln` creates a link to that file in the
    current directory.
-   If the `--target-directory` (`-t`) option is given, or failing that
    if the last file is a directory and the `--no-target-directory`
    (`-T`) option is not given, `ln` creates a link to each `target`
    file in the specified directory, using the `target`s’ names.

Normally `ln` does not replace existing files. Use the `--force` (`-f`)
option to replace them unconditionally, the `--interactive` (`-i`)
option to replace them conditionally, and the `--backup` (`-b`) option
to rename them. Unless the `--backup` (`-b`) option is used there is no
brief moment when the destination does not exist; this is an extension
to POSIX.

<span id="index-hard-link_002c-defined"></span> <span
id="index-inode_002c-and-hard-links"></span>

A *hard link* is another name for an existing file; the link and the
original are indistinguishable. Technically speaking, they share the
same inode, and the inode contains all the information about a
file—indeed, it is not incorrect to say that the inode *is* the file.
Most systems prohibit making a hard link to a directory; on those where
it is allowed, only the super-user can do so (and with caution, since
creating a cycle will cause problems to many other utilities). Hard
links cannot cross file system boundaries. (These restrictions are not
mandated by POSIX, however.)

<span id="index-dereferencing-symbolic-links"></span> <span
id="index-symbolic-link_002c-defined"></span>

*Symbolic links* (*symlinks* for short), on the other hand, are a
special file type (which not all kernels support: System V release 3
(and older) systems lack symlinks) in which the link file actually
refers to a different file, by name. When most operations (opening,
reading, writing, and so on) are passed the symbolic link file, the
kernel automatically *dereferences* the link and operates on the target
of the link. But some operations (e.g., removing) work on the link file
itself, rather than on its target. The owner and group of a symlink are
not significant to file access performed through the link, but do have
implications on deleting a symbolic link from a directory with the
restricted deletion bit set. On the GNU system, the mode of a symlink
has no significance and cannot be changed, but on some BSD systems, the
mode can be changed and will affect whether the symlink will be
traversed in file name resolution. See [Symbolic
Links](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_mono/libc.html#Symbolic-Links)
in The GNU C Library Reference Manual.

Symbolic links can contain arbitrary strings; a *dangling symlink*
occurs when the string in the symlink does not resolve to a file. There
are no restrictions against creating dangling symbolic links. There are
trade-offs to using absolute or relative symlinks. An absolute symlink
always points to the same file, even if the directory containing the
link is moved. However, if the symlink is visible from more than one
machine (such as on a networked file system), the file pointed to might
not always be the same. A relative symbolic link is resolved in relation
to the directory that contains the link, and is often useful in
referring to files on the same device without regards to what name that
device is mounted on when accessed via networked machines.

When creating a relative symlink in a different location than the
current directory, the resolution of the symlink will be different than
the resolution of the same string from the current directory. Therefore,
many users prefer to first change directories to the location where the
relative symlink will be created, so that tab-completion or other file
resolution will find the same target as what will be placed in the
symlink.

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`-b`’  
‘`--backup[=method]`’  
<span id="index-_002db-17"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dbackup-4"></span> <span
id="index-VERSION_005fCONTROL-4"></span> <span
id="index-backups_002c-making-4"></span>

See [Backup options](#Backup-options). Make a backup of each file that
would otherwise be overwritten or removed.

‘`-d`’  
‘`-F`’  
‘`--directory`’  
<span id="index-_002dd-14"></span> <span id="index-_002dF-4"></span>
<span id="index-_002d_002ddirectory-2"></span> <span
id="index-hard-links-to-directories"></span>

Allow users with appropriate privileges to attempt to make hard links to
directories. However, note that this will probably fail due to system
restrictions, even for the super-user.

‘`-f`’  
‘`--force`’  
<span id="index-_002df-14"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dforce-4"></span>

Remove existing destination files.

‘`-i`’  
‘`--interactive`’  
<span id="index-_002di-14"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dinteractive-3"></span> <span
id="index-prompting_002c-and-ln"></span>

Prompt whether to remove existing destination files.

‘`-L`’  
‘`--logical`’  
<span id="index-_002dL-4"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dlogical"></span>

If `-s` is not in effect, and the source file is a symbolic link, create
the hard link to the file referred to by the symbolic link, rather than
the symbolic link itself.

‘`-n`’  
‘`--no-dereference`’  
<span id="index-_002dn-13"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dno_002ddereference-1"></span>

Do not treat the last operand specially when it is a symbolic link to a
directory. Instead, treat it as if it were a normal file.

When the destination is an actual directory (not a symlink to one),
there is no ambiguity. The link is created in that directory. But when
the specified destination is a symlink to a directory, there are two
ways to treat the user’s request. `ln` can treat the destination just as
it would a normal directory and create the link in it. On the other
hand, the destination can be viewed as a non-directory—as the symlink
itself. In that case, `ln` must delete or backup that symlink before
creating the new link. The default is to treat a destination that is a
symlink to a directory just like a directory.

This option is weaker than the `--no-target-directory` (`-T`) option, so
it has no effect if both options are given.

‘`-P`’  
‘`--physical`’  
<span id="index-_002dP-2"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dphysical"></span>

If `-s` is not in effect, and the source file is a symbolic link, create
the hard link to the symbolic link itself. On platforms where this is
not supported by the kernel, this option creates a symbolic link with
identical contents; since symbolic link contents cannot be edited, any
file name resolution performed through either link will be the same as
if a hard link had been created.

‘`-r`’  
‘`--relative`’  
<span id="index-_002dr-9"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002drelative"></span>

Make symbolic links relative to the link location. This option is only
valid with the `--symbolic` option.

Example:

<div class="example">

``` example
ln -srv /a/file /tmp
'/tmp/file' -> '../a/file'
```

</div>

Relative symbolic links are generated based on their canonicalized
containing directory, and canonicalized targets. I.e., all symbolic
links in these file names will be resolved. See [realpath
invocation](#realpath-invocation), which gives greater control over
relative file name generation, as demonstrated in the following example:

<div class="example">

``` verbatim
ln--relative() {
  test "$1" = --no-symlinks && { nosym=$1; shift; }
  target="$1";
  test -d "$2" && link="$2/." || link="$2"
  rtarget="$(realpath $nosym -m "$target" \
              --relative-to "$(dirname "$link")")"
  ln -s -v "$rtarget" "$link"
}
```

</div>

‘`-s`’  
‘`--symbolic`’  
<span id="index-_002ds-18"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dsymbolic"></span>

Make symbolic links instead of hard links. This option merely produces
an error message on systems that do not support symbolic links.

‘`-S suffix`’  
‘`--suffix=suffix`’  
<span id="index-_002dS-9"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dsuffix-4"></span>

Append `suffix` to each backup file made with `-b`. See [Backup
options](#Backup-options).

‘`-t directory`’  
‘`--target-directory=directory`’  
<span id="index-_002dt-14"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dtarget_002ddirectory-4"></span> <span
id="index-target-directory-9"></span> <span
id="index-destination-directory-8"></span>

Specify the destination `directory`. See [Target
directory](#Target-directory).

‘`-T`’  
‘`--no-target-directory`’  
<span id="index-_002dT-8"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dno_002dtarget_002ddirectory-4"></span> <span
id="index-target-directory-10"></span> <span
id="index-destination-directory-9"></span>

Do not treat the last operand specially when it is a directory or a
symbolic link to a directory. See [Target directory](#Target-directory).

‘`-v`’  
‘`--verbose`’  
<span id="index-_002dv-12"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dverbose-8"></span>

Print the name of each file after linking it successfully.

<span id="index-hard-links-to-symbolic-links"></span> <span
id="index-symbolic-links-and-ln"></span>

If `-L` and `-P` are both given, the last one takes precedence. If `-s`
is also given, `-L` and `-P` are silently ignored. If neither option is
given, then this implementation defaults to `-P` if the system `link`
supports hard links to symbolic links (such as the GNU system), and `-L`
if `link` follows symbolic links (such as on BSD).

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

Examples:

<div class="example">

``` example
Bad Example:

# Create link ../a pointing to a in that directory.
# Not really useful because it points to itself.
ln -s a ..

Better Example:

# Change to the target before creating symlinks to avoid being confused.
cd ..
ln -s adir/a .

Bad Example:

# Hard coded file names don't move well.
ln -s $(pwd)/a /some/dir/

Better Example:

# Relative file names survive directory moves and also
# work across networked file systems.
ln -s afile anotherfile
ln -s ../adir/afile yetanotherfile
```

### 12.3 `mkdir`: Make directories

<span id="index-mkdir"></span> <span
id="index-directories_002c-creating"></span> <span
id="index-creating-directories"></span>

`mkdir` creates directories with the specified names. Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
mkdir [option]… name…
```

</div>

`mkdir` creates each directory `name` in the order given. It reports an
error if `name` already exists, unless the `-p` option is given and
`name` is a directory.

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`-m mode`’  
‘`--mode=mode`’  
<span id="index-_002dm-5"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dmode-1"></span> <span
id="index-modes-of-created-directories_002c-setting"></span>

Set the file permission bits of created directories to `mode`, which
uses the same syntax as in `chmod` and uses ‘`a=rwx`’ (read, write and
execute allowed for everyone) for the point of the departure. See [File
permissions](#File-permissions). This option affects only directories
given on the command line; it does not affect any parents that may be
created via the `-p` option.

Normally the directory has the desired file mode bits at the moment it
is created. As a GNU extension, `mode` may also mention special mode
bits, but in this case there may be a temporary window during which the
directory exists but its special mode bits are incorrect. See [Directory
Setuid and Setgid](#Directory-Setuid-and-Setgid), for how the
set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits of directories are inherited unless
overridden in this way.

‘`-p`’  
‘`--parents`’  
<span id="index-_002dp-5"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dparents-1"></span> <span
id="index-parent-directories_002c-creating"></span>

Make any missing parent directories for each argument, setting their
file permission bits to ‘`=rwx,u+wx`’, that is, with the umask modified
by ‘`u+wx`’. Ignore existing parent directories, and do not change their
file permission bits.

If the `-m` option is also given, it does not affect file permission
bits of any newly-created parent directories. To control these bits, set
the umask before invoking `mkdir`. For example, if the shell command
‘`(umask u=rwx,go=rx; mkdir -p P/Q)`’ creates the parent `P` it sets the
parent’s file permission bits to ‘`u=rwx,go=rx`’. (The umask must
include ‘`u=wx`’ for this method to work.) To set a parent’s special
mode bits as well, you can invoke `chmod` after `mkdir`. See [Directory
Setuid and Setgid](#Directory-Setuid-and-Setgid), for how the
set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits of newly-created parent directories
are inherited.

‘`-v`’  
‘`--verbose`’  
<span id="index-_002dv-13"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dverbose-9"></span>

Print a message for each created directory. This is most useful with
`--parents`.

‘`-Z`’  
‘`--context[=context]`’  
<span id="index-_002dZ-4"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dcontext-4"></span> <span
id="index-SELinux_002c-setting_002frestoring-security-context-2"></span>
<span id="index-security-context-5"></span>

Without a specified `context`, adjust the SELinux security context
according to the system default type for destination files, similarly to
the `restorecon` command. The long form of this option with a specific
context specified, will set the context for newly created files only.
With a specified context, if both SELinux and SMACK are disabled, a
warning is issued.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

<span id="index-mkfifo"></span> <span
id="index-FIFOs_002c-creating"></span> <span
id="index-named-pipes_002c-creating"></span> <span
id="index-creating-FIFOs-_0028named-pipes_0029"></span>

`mkfifo` creates FIFOs (also called *named pipes*) with the specified
names. Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
mkfifo [option] name…
```

</div>

A *FIFO* is a special file type that permits independent processes to
communicate. One process opens the FIFO file for writing, and another
for reading, after which data can flow as with the usual anonymous pipe
in shells or elsewhere.

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`-m mode`’  
‘`--mode=mode`’  
<span id="index-_002dm-6"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dmode-2"></span> <span
id="index-modes-of-created-FIFOs_002c-setting"></span>

Set the mode of created FIFOs to `mode`, which is symbolic as in `chmod`
and uses ‘`a=rw`’ (read and write allowed for everyone) for the point of
departure. `mode` should specify only file permission bits. See [File
permissions](#File-permissions).

‘`-Z`’  
‘`--context[=context]`’  
<span id="index-_002dZ-5"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dcontext-5"></span> <span
id="index-SELinux_002c-setting_002frestoring-security-context-3"></span>
<span id="index-security-context-6"></span>

Without a specified `context`, adjust the SELinux security context
according to the system default type for destination files, similarly to
the `restorecon` command. The long form of this option with a specific
context specified, will set the context for newly created files only.
With a specified context, if both SELinux and SMACK are disabled, a

### 12.5 `mknod`: Make block or character special files

<span id="index-mknod"></span> <span
id="index-block-special-files_002c-creating"></span> <span
id="index-character-special-files_002c-creating"></span>

`mknod` creates a FIFO, character special file, or block special file
with the specified name. Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
mknod [option]… name type [major minor]
```

</div>

<span id="index-special-files"></span> <span
id="index-block-special-files"></span> <span
id="index-character-special-files"></span>

Unlike the phrase “special file type” above, the term *special file* has
a technical meaning on Unix: something that can generate or receive
data. Usually this corresponds to a physical piece of hardware, e.g., a
printer or a flash drive. (These files are typically created at
system-configuration time.) The `mknod` command is what creates files of
this type. Such devices can be read either a character at a time or a
“block” (many characters) at a time, hence we say there are *block
special* files and *character special* files.

<span id="index-conflicts-with-shell-built_002dins"></span> <span
id="index-built_002din-shell-commands_002c-conflicts-with"></span>

Due to shell aliases and built-in `mknod` functions, using an unadorned
`mknod` interactively or in a script may get you different functionality
than that described here. Invoke it via `env` (i.e., `env mknod …`) to
avoid interference from the shell.

The arguments after `name` specify the type of file to make:

‘`p`’  
<span id="index-p-for-FIFO-file"></span>

for a FIFO

‘`b`’  
<span id="index-b-for-block-special-file"></span>

for a block special file

‘`c`’  
<span id="index-c-for-character-special-file"></span>

for a character special file

When making a block or character special file, the major and minor
device numbers must be given after the file type. If a major or minor
device number begins with ‘`0x`’ or ‘`0X`’, it is interpreted as
hexadecimal; otherwise, if it begins with ‘`0`’, as octal; otherwise, as
decimal.

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`-m mode`’  
‘`--mode=mode`’  
<span id="index-_002dm-7"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dmode-3"></span>

Set the mode of created files to `mode`, which is symbolic as in `chmod`
and uses ‘`a=rw`’ as the point of departure. `mode` should specify only
file permission bits. See [File permissions](#File-permissions).

‘`-Z`’  
‘`--context[=context]`’  
<span id="index-_002dZ-6"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dcontext-6"></span> <span
id="index-SELinux_002c-setting_002frestoring-security-context-4"></span>
<span id="index-security-context-7"></span>

Without a specified `context`, adjust the SELinux security context
according to the system default type for destination files, similarly to
the `restorecon` command. The long form of this option with a specific
context specified, will set the context for newly created files only.
With a specified context, if both SELinux and SMACK are disabled, a
warning is issued.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

### 12.6 `readlink`: Print value of a symlink or canonical file name

<span id="index-readlink"></span> <span
id="index-displaying-value-of-a-symbolic-link"></span> <span
id="index-canonical-file-name"></span> <span
id="index-canonicalize-a-file-name"></span> <span
id="index-realpath"></span>

`readlink` may work in one of two supported modes:

‘`Readlink mode`’  
`readlink` outputs the value of the given symbolic links. If `readlink`
is invoked with an argument other than the name of a symbolic link, it
produces no output and exits with a nonzero exit code.

‘`Canonicalize mode`’  
`readlink` outputs the absolute name of the given files which contain no
`.`, `..` components nor any repeated separators (`/`) or symbolic
links. Note the `realpath` command is the preferred command to use for
canonicalization. See [realpath invocation](#realpath-invocation).

<div class="example">

``` example
readlink [option]… file…
```

</div>

By default, `readlink` operates in readlink mode.

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`-f`’  
‘`--canonicalize`’  
<span id="index-_002df-15"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dcanonicalize"></span>

Activate canonicalize mode. If any component of the file name except the
last one is missing or unavailable, `readlink` produces no output and
exits with a nonzero exit code. A trailing slash is ignored.

‘`-e`’  
‘`--canonicalize-existing`’  
<span id="index-_002de-4"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dcanonicalize_002dexisting"></span>

Activate canonicalize mode. If any component is missing or unavailable,
`readlink` produces no output and exits with a nonzero exit code. A
trailing slash requires that the name resolve to a directory.

‘`-m`’  
‘`--canonicalize-missing`’  
<span id="index-_002dm-8"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dcanonicalize_002dmissing"></span>

Activate canonicalize mode. If any component is missing or unavailable,
`readlink` treats it as a directory.

‘`-n`’  
‘`--no-newline`’  
<span id="index-_002dn-14"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dno_002dnewline"></span>

Do not print the output delimiter, when a single `file` is specified.
Print a warning if specified along with multiple `file`s.

‘`-s`’  
‘`-q`’  
‘`--silent`’  
‘`--quiet`’  
<span id="index-_002ds-19"></span> <span id="index-_002dq-4"></span>
<span id="index-_002d_002dsilent-3"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dquiet-4"></span>

Suppress most error messages. On by default.

‘`-v`’  
‘`--verbose`’  
<span id="index-_002dv-14"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dverbose-10"></span>

Report error messages.

‘`-z`’  
‘`--zero`’  
<span id="index-_002dz-12"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dzero-3"></span> <span
id="index-output-NUL_002dbyte_002dterminated-lines-2"></span>

Output a zero byte (ASCII NUL) at the end of each line, rather than a
newline. This option enables other programs to parse the output even
when that output would contain data with embedded newlines.

The `readlink` utility first appeared in OpenBSD 2.1.

The `realpath` command without options, operates like `readlink` in
canonicalize mode.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

### 12.7 `rmdir`: Remove empty directories

<span id="index-rmdir"></span> <span
id="index-removing-empty-directories"></span> <span
id="index-directories_002c-removing-empty"></span>

`rmdir` removes empty directories. Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
rmdir [option]… directory…
```

</div>

If any `directory` argument does not refer to an existing empty
directory, it is an error.

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`--ignore-fail-on-non-empty`’  
<span
id="index-_002d_002dignore_002dfail_002don_002dnon_002dempty"></span>
<span id="index-directory-deletion_002c-ignoring-failures"></span>

Ignore each failure to remove a directory that is solely because the
directory is non-empty.

‘`-p`’  
‘`--parents`’  
<span id="index-_002dp-6"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dparents-2"></span> <span
id="index-parent-directories_002c-removing"></span>

Remove `directory`, then try to remove each component of `directory`.
So, for example, ‘`rmdir -p a/b/c`’ is similar to ‘`rmdir a/b/c a/b a`’.
As such, it fails if any of those directories turns out not to be empty.
Use the `--ignore-fail-on-non-empty` option to make it so such a failure
does not evoke a diagnostic and does not cause `rmdir` to exit
unsuccessfully.

‘`-v`’  
‘`--verbose`’  
<span id="index-_002dv-15"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dverbose-11"></span> <span
id="index-directory-deletion_002c-reporting"></span>

Give a diagnostic for each successful removal. `directory` is removed.

See [rm invocation](#rm-invocation), for how to remove non-empty
directories recursively.

To remove all empty directories under `dirname`, including directories
that become empty because other directories are removed, you can use
either of the following commands:

<div class="example">

``` example
# This uses GNU extensions.
find dirname -type d -empty -delete

# This runs on any POSIX platform.
find dirname -depth -type d -exec rmdir {} +
```

</div>

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

### 12.8 `unlink`: Remove files via the unlink syscall

<span id="index-unlink"></span> <span
id="index-removing-files-or-directories-_0028via-the-unlink-syscall_0029"></span>

`unlink` deletes a single specified file name. It is a minimalist
interface to the system-provided `unlink` function. See [Deleting
Files](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_mono/libc.html#Deleting-Files)
in The GNU C Library Reference Manual. Synopsis: It avoids the bells and
whistles of the more commonly-used `rm` command (see [rm
invocation](#rm-invocation)).

<div class="example">

``` example
unlink filename
```

</div>

On some systems `unlink` can be used to delete the name of a directory.
On others, it can be used that way only by a privileged user. In the GNU
system `unlink` can never delete the name of a directory.

The `unlink` command honors the `--help` and `--version` options. To
remove a file whose name begins with ‘`-`’, prefix the name with ‘`./`’,
e.g., ‘`unlink ./--help`’.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

## 13 Changing file attributes

<span id="index-changing-file-attributes"></span> <span
id="index-file-attributes_002c-changing"></span> <span
id="index-attributes_002c-file"></span>

A file is not merely its contents, a name, and a file type (see [Special
file types](#Special-file-types)). A file also has an owner (a user ID),
a group (a group ID), permissions (what the owner can do with the file,
what people in the group can do, and what everyone else can do), various
timestamps, and other information. Collectively, we call these a file’s
*attributes*.

These commands change file attributes.

|                                                                  |     |                                |

<span id="chown_003a-Change-file-owner-and-group"></span>

### 13.1 `chown`: Change file owner and group

<span id="index-chown"></span> <span
id="index-file-ownership_002c-changing"></span> <span
id="index-group-ownership_002c-changing"></span> <span
id="index-changing-file-ownership"></span> <span
id="index-changing-group-ownership"></span>

`chown` changes the user and/or group ownership of each given `file` to
`new-owner` or to the user and group of an existing reference file.
Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
chown [option]… {new-owner | --reference=ref_file} file…
```

</div>

If used, `new-owner` specifies the new owner and/or group as follows
(with no embedded white space):

<div class="example">

``` example
[owner] [ : [group] ]
```

</div>

Specifically:

`owner`  
If only an `owner` (a user name or numeric user ID) is given, that user
is made the owner of each given file, and the files’ group is not
changed.

`owner‘:’group`  
If the `owner` is followed by a colon and a `group` (a group name or
numeric group ID), with no spaces between them, the group ownership of
the files is changed as well (to `group`).

`owner‘:’`  
If a colon but no group name follows `owner`, that user is made the
owner of the files and the group of the files is changed to `owner`’s
login group.

`‘:’group`  
If the colon and following `group` are given, but the owner is omitted,
only the group of the files is changed; in this case, `chown` performs
the same function as `chgrp`.

`‘:’`  
If only a colon is given, or if `new-owner` is empty, neither the owner
nor the group is changed.

If `owner` or `group` is intended to represent a numeric user or group
ID, then you may specify it with a leading ‘`+`’. See [Disambiguating
names and IDs](#Disambiguating-names-and-IDs).

Some older scripts may still use ‘`.`’ in place of the ‘`:`’ separator.
POSIX 1003.1-2001 (see [Standards conformance](#Standards-conformance))
does not require support for that, but for backward compatibility GNU
`chown` supports ‘`.`’ so long as no ambiguity results, although it
issues a warning and support may be removed in future versions. New
scripts should avoid the use of ‘`.`’ because it is not portable, and
because it has undesirable results if the entire `owner‘.’group` happens
to identify a user whose name contains ‘`.`’.

It is system dependent whether a user can change the group to an
arbitrary one, or the more portable behavior of being restricted to
setting a group of which the user is a member.

The `chown` command sometimes clears the set-user-ID or set-group-ID
permission bits. This behavior depends on the policy and functionality
of the underlying `chown` system call, which may make system-dependent
file mode modifications outside the control of the `chown` command. For
example, the `chown` command might not affect those bits when invoked by
a user with appropriate privileges, or when the bits signify some
function other than executable permission (e.g., mandatory locking).
When in doubt, check the underlying system behavior.

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`-c`’  
‘`--changes`’  
<span id="index-_002dc-15"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dchanges"></span> <span
id="index-changed-owners_002c-verbosely-describing"></span>

Verbosely describe the action for each `file` whose ownership actually
changes.

‘`-f`’  
‘`--silent`’  
‘`--quiet`’  
<span id="index-_002df-16"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dsilent-4"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dquiet-5"></span> <span
id="index-error-messages_002c-omitting"></span>

Do not print error messages about files whose ownership cannot be
changed.

‘`--from=old-owner`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dfrom"></span> <span
id="index-symbolic-links_002c-changing-owner"></span>

Change a `file`’s ownership only if it has current attributes specified
by `old-owner`. `old-owner` has the same form as `new-owner` described
above. This option is useful primarily from a security standpoint in
that it narrows considerably the window of potential abuse. For example,
to reflect a user ID numbering change for one user’s files without an
option like this, `root` might run

<div class="example">

``` example
find / -owner OLDUSER -print0 | xargs -0 chown -h NEWUSER
```

</div>

But that is dangerous because the interval between when the `find` tests
the existing file’s owner and when the `chown` is actually run may be
quite large. One way to narrow the gap would be to invoke chown for each
file as it is found:

<div class="example">

``` example
find / -owner OLDUSER -exec chown -h NEWUSER {} \;
```

</div>

But that is very slow if there are many affected files. With this
option, it is safer (the gap is narrower still) though still not
perfect:

<div class="example">

``` example
chown -h -R --from=OLDUSER NEWUSER /
```

</div>

‘`--dereference`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002ddereference-2"></span> <span
id="index-symbolic-links_002c-changing-owner-1"></span> <span
id="index-lchown"></span>

Do not act on symbolic links themselves but rather on what they point
to. This is the default when not operating recursively.

Combining this dereferencing option with the `--recursive` option may
create a security risk: During the traversal of the directory tree, an
attacker may be able to introduce a symlink to an arbitrary target; when
the tool reaches that, the operation will be performed on the target of
that symlink, possibly allowing the attacker to escalate privileges.

‘`-h`’  
‘`--no-dereference`’  
<span id="index-_002dh-5"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dno_002ddereference-2"></span> <span
id="index-symbolic-links_002c-changing-owner-2"></span> <span
id="index-lchown-1"></span>

Act on symbolic links themselves instead of what they point to. This
mode relies on the `lchown` system call. On systems that do not provide
the `lchown` system call, `chown` fails when a file specified on the
command line is a symbolic link. By default, no diagnostic is issued for
symbolic links encountered during a recursive traversal, but see
`--verbose`.

‘`--preserve-root`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dpreserve_002droot-1"></span> <span
id="index-root-directory_002c-disallow-recursive-modification"></span>

Fail upon any attempt to recursively change the root directory, `/`.
Without `--recursive`, this option has no effect. See [Treating /
specially](#Treating-_002f-specially).

‘`--no-preserve-root`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dno_002dpreserve_002droot-1"></span> <span
id="index-root-directory_002c-allow-recursive-modification"></span>

Cancel the effect of any preceding `--preserve-root` option. See
[Treating / specially](#Treating-_002f-specially).

‘`--reference=ref_file`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dreference"></span>

Change the user and group of each `file` to be the same as those of
`ref_file`. If `ref_file` is a symbolic link, do not use the user and
group of the symbolic link, but rather those of the file it refers to.

‘`-v`’  
‘`--verbose`’  
<span id="index-_002dv-16"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dverbose-12"></span>

Output a diagnostic for every file processed. If a symbolic link is
encountered during a recursive traversal on a system without the
`lchown` system call, and `--no-dereference` is in effect, then issue a
diagnostic saying neither the symbolic link nor its referent is being
changed.

‘`-R`’  
‘`--recursive`’  
<span id="index-_002dR-5"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002drecursive-3"></span> <span
id="index-recursively-changing-file-ownership"></span>

Recursively change ownership of directories and their contents.

‘`-H`’  
<span id="index-_002dH-3"></span> <span
id="index-symbolic-link-to-directory_002c-traverse-if-on-the-command-line-1"></span>

If `--recursive` (`-R`) is specified and a command line argument is a
symbolic link to a directory, traverse it. See [Traversing
symlinks](#Traversing-symlinks).

‘`-L`’  
<span id="index-_002dL-5"></span> <span
id="index-symbolic-link-to-directory_002c-traverse-each-that-is-encountered-1"></span>

In a recursive traversal, traverse every symbolic link to a directory
that is encountered.

Combining this dereferencing option with the `--recursive` option may
create a security risk: During the traversal of the directory tree, an
attacker may be able to introduce a symlink to an arbitrary target; when
the tool reaches that, the operation will be performed on the target of
that symlink, possibly allowing the attacker to escalate privileges.

See [Traversing symlinks](#Traversing-symlinks).

‘`-P`’  
<span id="index-_002dP-3"></span> <span
id="index-symbolic-link-to-directory_002c-never-traverse-1"></span>

Do not traverse any symbolic links. This is the default if none of `-H`,
`-L`, or `-P` is specified. See [Traversing
symlinks](#Traversing-symlinks).

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

Examples:

<div class="example">

``` example
# Change the owner of /u to "root".
chown root /u

# Likewise, but also change its group to "staff".
chown root:staff /u

<span id="index-chgrp"></span> <span
id="index-group-ownership_002c-changing-1"></span> <span
id="index-changing-group-ownership-1"></span>

`chgrp` changes the group ownership of each given `file` to `group`
(which can be either a group name or a numeric group ID) or to the group
of an existing reference file. See [chown
invocation](#chown-invocation). Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example

</div>

If `group` is intended to represent a numeric group ID, then you may
specify it with a leading ‘`+`’. See [Disambiguating names and

‘`-v`’  
‘`--verbose`’  
<span id="index-_002dv-17"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dverbose-13"></span>

Output a diagnostic for every file processed. If a symbolic link is

In a recursive traversal, traverse every symbolic link to a directory
that is encountered.

Combining this dereferencing option with the `--recursive` option may
create a security risk: During the traversal of the directory tree, an
attacker may be able to introduce a symlink to an arbitrary target; when
the tool reaches that, the operation will be performed on the target of
that symlink, possibly allowing the attacker to escalate privileges.

### 13.3 `chmod`: Change access permissions

<span id="index-chmod"></span> <span
id="index-changing-access-permissions"></span> <span
id="index-access-permissions_002c-changing"></span> <span
id="index-permissions_002c-changing-access"></span>

`chmod` changes the access permissions of the named files. Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
chmod [option]… {mode | --reference=ref_file} file…
```

</div>

<span id="index-symbolic-links_002c-permissions-of"></span>

`chmod` never changes the permissions of symbolic links, since the
`chmod` system call cannot change their permissions. This is not a
problem since the permissions of symbolic links are never used. However,
for each symbolic link listed on the command line, `chmod` changes the
permissions of the pointed-to file. In contrast, `chmod` ignores
symbolic links encountered during recursive directory traversals.

Only a process whose effective user ID matches the user ID of the file,
or a process with appropriate privileges, is permitted to change the
file mode bits of a file.

A successful use of `chmod` clears the set-group-ID bit of a regular
file if the file’s group ID does not match the user’s effective group ID
or one of the user’s supplementary group IDs, unless the user has
appropriate privileges. Additional restrictions may cause the
set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits of `mode` or `ref_file` to be ignored.
This behavior depends on the policy and functionality of the underlying
`chmod` system call. When in doubt, check the underlying system
behavior.

If used, `mode` specifies the new file mode bits. For details, see the
section on [File permissions](#File-permissions). If you really want
`mode` to have a leading ‘`-`’, you should use `--` first, e.g.,
‘`chmod -- -w file`’. Typically, though, ‘`chmod a-w file`’ is
preferable, and `chmod -w file` (without the `--`) complains if it
behaves differently from what ‘`chmod a-w file`’ would do.

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`-c`’  
‘`--changes`’  
<span id="index-_002dc-17"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dchanges-2"></span>

<span id="index-_002d_002dpreserve_002droot-3"></span> <span
id="index-root-directory_002c-disallow-recursive-modification-2"></span>

Fail upon any attempt to recursively change the root directory, `/`.
Without `--recursive`, this option has no effect. See [Treating /

‘`--no-preserve-root`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dno_002dpreserve_002droot-3"></span> <span

‘`-v`’  
‘`--verbose`’  
<span id="index-_002dv-18"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dverbose-14"></span>

Verbosely describe the action or non-action taken for every `file`.

‘`--reference=ref_file`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dreference-2"></span>

Change the mode of each `file` to be the same as that of `ref_file`. See
[File permissions](#File-permissions). If `ref_file` is a symbolic link,
do not use the mode of the symbolic link, but rather that of the file it
refers to.

‘`-R`’  
‘`--recursive`’  
<span id="index-_002dR-7"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002drecursive-5"></span> <span

### 13.4 `touch`: Change file timestamps

<span id="index-touch"></span> <span
id="index-changing-file-timestamps"></span> <span
id="index-file-timestamps_002c-changing"></span> <span
id="index-timestamps_002c-changing-file"></span>

`touch` changes the access and/or modification timestamps of the
specified files. Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
touch [option]… file…
```

</div>

<span id="index-empty-files_002c-creating"></span>

Any `file` argument that does not exist is created empty, unless option
`--no-create` (`-c`) or `--no-dereference` (`-h`) was in effect.

A `file` argument string of ‘`-`’ is handled specially and causes
`touch` to change the times of the file associated with standard output.

By default, `touch` sets file timestamps to the current time. Because
`touch` acts on its operands left to right, the resulting timestamps of
earlier and later operands may disagree.

<span id="index-permissions_002c-for-changing-file-timestamps"></span>

When setting file timestamps to the current time, `touch` can change the
timestamps for files that the user does not own but has write permission
for. Otherwise, the user must own the files. Some older systems have a
further restriction: the user must own the files unless both the access
and modification timestamps are being set to the current time.

The `touch` command cannot set a file’s status change timestamp to a
user-specified value, and cannot change the file’s birth time (if
supported) at all. Also, `touch` has issues similar to those affecting
all programs that update file timestamps. For example, `touch` may set a
file’s timestamp to a value that differs slightly from the requested
time. See [File timestamps](#File-timestamps).

<span id="index-TZ-2"></span>

Timestamps assume the time zone rules specified by the `TZ` environment
variable, or by the system default rules if `TZ` is not set. See
[Specifying the Time Zone with
`TZ`](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_mono/libc.html#TZ-Variable)
in The GNU C Library Reference Manual. You can avoid ambiguities during
daylight saving transitions by using UTC timestamps.

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`-a`’  
‘`--time=atime`’  
‘`--time=access`’  
‘`--time=use`’  
<span id="index-_002da-8"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dtime-3"></span> <span
id="index-atime_002c-changing"></span> <span
id="index-access-time_002c-changing"></span> <span
id="index-use-time_002c-changing"></span>

Change the access timestamp only. See [File
timestamps](#File-timestamps).

‘`-c`’  
‘`--no-create`’  
<span id="index-_002dc-18"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dno_002dcreate"></span>

Do not warn about or create files that do not exist.

‘`-d time`’  
‘`--date=time`’  
<span id="index-_002dd-15"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002ddate"></span> <span id="index-time"></span>

Use `time` instead of the current time. It can contain month names, time
zones, ‘`am`’ and ‘`pm`’, ‘`yesterday`’, etc. For example,
`--date="2020-07-21 14:19:13.489392193 +0530"` specifies the instant of
time that is 489,392,193 nanoseconds after July 21, 2020 at 2:19:13 PM
in a time zone that is 5 hours and 30 minutes east of UTC. See [Date
input formats](#Date-input-formats). File systems that do not support
high-resolution timestamps silently ignore any excess precision here.

‘`-f`’  
<span id="index-_002df-19"></span> <span
id="index-BSD-touch-compatibility"></span>

Ignored; for compatibility with BSD versions of `touch`.

‘`-h`’  
‘`--no-dereference`’  
<span id="index-_002dh-7"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dno_002ddereference-4"></span> <span
id="index-symbolic-links_002c-changing-time"></span> <span
id="index-lutimes"></span>

Attempt to change the timestamps of a symbolic link, rather than what
the link refers to. When using this option, empty files are not created,
but option `-c` must also be used to avoid warning about files that do
not exist. Not all systems support changing the timestamps of symlinks,
since underlying system support for this action was not required until
POSIX 2008. Also, on some systems, the mere act of examining a symbolic
link changes the access timestamp, such that only changes to the
modification timestamp will persist long enough to be observable. When
coupled with option `-r`, a reference timestamp is taken from a symbolic
link rather than the file it refers to.

‘`-m`’  
‘`--time=mtime`’  
‘`--time=modify`’  
<span id="index-_002dm-9"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dtime-4"></span> <span
id="index-mtime_002c-changing"></span> <span
id="index-modify-time_002c-changing"></span>

Change the modification timestamp only.

‘`-r file`’  
‘`--reference=file`’  
<span id="index-_002dr-10"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dreference-3"></span>

Use the times of the reference `file` instead of the current time. If
this option is combined with the `--date=time` (`-d time`) option, the
reference `file`’s time is the origin for any relative `time`s given,
but is otherwise ignored. For example, ‘`-r foo -d '-5 seconds'`’
specifies a timestamp equal to five seconds before the corresponding
timestamp for `foo`. If `file` is a symbolic link, the reference
timestamp is taken from the target of the symlink, unless `-h` was also
in effect.

‘`-t [[cc]yy]mmddhhmm[.ss]`’  
<span id="index-leap-seconds"></span>

Use the argument (optional four-digit or two-digit years, months, days,
hours, minutes, optional seconds) instead of the current time. If the
year is specified with only two digits, then `cc` is 20 for years in the
range 0 … 68, and 19 for years in 69 … 99. If no digits of the year are
specified, the argument is interpreted as a date in the current year. On
the atypical systems that support leap seconds, `ss` may be ‘`60`’.

<span id="index-_005fPOSIX2_005fVERSION-4"></span>

On systems predating POSIX 1003.1-2001, `touch` supports an obsolete
syntax, as follows. If no timestamp is given with any of the `-d`, `-r`,
or `-t` options, and if there are two or more `file`s and the first
`file` is of the form ‘`mmddhhmm[yy]`’ and this would be a valid
argument to the `-t` option (if the `yy`, if any, were moved to the
front), and if the represented year is in the range 1969–1999, that
argument is interpreted as the time for the other files instead of as a
file name. Although this obsolete behavior can be controlled with the
`_POSIX2_VERSION` environment variable (see [Standards
conformance](#Standards-conformance)), portable scripts should avoid
commands whose behavior depends on this variable. For example, use
‘`touch ./12312359 main.c`’ or ‘`touch -t 12312359 main.c`’ rather than
the ambiguous ‘`touch 12312359 main.c`’.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

### 14.1 `df`: Report file system space usage

<span id="index-df"></span> <span id="index-file-system-usage"></span>
<span id="index-disk-usage-by-file-system"></span>

`df` reports the amount of space used and available on file systems.
Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
df [option]… [file]…
```

</div>

With no arguments, `df` reports the space used and available on all
currently mounted file systems (of all types). Otherwise, `df` reports
on the file system containing each argument `file`.

Normally the space is printed in units of 1024 bytes, but this can be
overridden (see [Block size](#Block-size)). Non-integer quantities are
rounded up to the next higher unit.

For bind mounts and without arguments, `df` only outputs the statistics
for that device with the shortest mount point name in the list of file
systems (`mtab`), i.e., it hides duplicate entries, unless the `-a`
option is specified.

With the same logic, `df` elides a mount entry of a dummy pseudo device
if there is another mount entry of a real block device for that mount
point with the same device number, e.g. the early-boot pseudo file
system ‘`rootfs`’ is not shown per default when already the real root
device has been mounted.

<span id="index-disk-device-file"></span> <span
id="index-device-file"></span>

If an argument `file` resolves to a special file containing a mounted
file system, `df` shows the space available on that file system rather
than on the file system containing the device node. GNU `df` does not
attempt to determine the usage on unmounted file systems, because on
most kinds of systems doing so requires extremely nonportable intimate
knowledge of file system structures.

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`-a`’  
‘`--all`’  
<span id="index-_002da-9"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dall-2"></span> <span
id="index-ignore-file-systems"></span>

Include in the listing dummy, duplicate, or inaccessible file systems,
which are omitted by default. Dummy file systems are typically special
purpose pseudo file systems such as ‘`/proc`’, with no associated
storage. Duplicate file systems are local or remote file systems that
are mounted at separate locations in the local file hierarchy, or bind
mounted locations. Inaccessible file systems are those which are mounted
but subsequently over-mounted by another file system at that point, or
otherwise inaccessible due to permissions of the mount point etc.

‘`-B size`’  
‘`--block-size=size`’  
<span id="index-_002dB-1"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dblock_002dsize-1"></span> <span
id="index-file-system-sizes"></span>

Scale sizes by `size` before printing them (see [Block
size](#Block-size)). For example, `-BG` prints sizes in units of
1,073,741,824 bytes.

‘`-h`’  
‘`--human-readable`’  
<span id="index-_002dh-8"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dhuman_002dreadable-2"></span> <span
id="index-human_002dreadable-output-2"></span>

Append a size letter to each size, such as ‘`M`’ for mebibytes. Powers
of 1024 are used, not 1000; ‘`M`’ stands for 1,048,576 bytes. This
option is equivalent to `--block-size=human-readable`. Use the `--si`
option if you prefer powers of 1000.

‘`-H`’  
<span id="index-_002dH-5"></span>

Equivalent to `--si`.

‘`-i`’  
‘`--inodes`’  
<span id="index-_002di-15"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dinodes"></span> <span id="index-inode-usage"></span>

List inode usage information instead of block usage. An inode (short for
index node) contains information about a file such as its owner,
permissions, timestamps, and location on the file system.

‘`-k`’  
<span id="index-_002dk-4"></span> <span
id="index-kibibytes-for-file-system-sizes"></span>

Print sizes in 1024-byte blocks, overriding the default block size (see
[Block size](#Block-size)). This option is equivalent to
`--block-size=1K`.

‘`-l`’  
‘`--local`’  
<span id="index-_002dl-8"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dlocal"></span> <span
id="index-file-system-types_002c-limiting-output-to-certain"></span>

Limit the listing to local file systems. By default, remote file systems
are also listed.

‘`--no-sync`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dno_002dsync"></span> <span
id="index-file-system-space_002c-retrieving-old-data-more-quickly"></span>

Do not invoke the `sync` system call before getting any usage data. This
may make `df` run significantly faster on systems with many file
systems, but on some systems (notably Solaris) the results may be
slightly out of date. This is the default.

‘`--output`’  
‘`--output[=field_list]`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002doutput-2"></span>

Use the output format defined by `field_list`, or print all fields if
`field_list` is omitted. In the latter case, the order of the columns
conforms to the order of the field descriptions below.

The use of the `--output` together with each of the options `-i`, `-P`,
and `-T` is mutually exclusive.

FIELD_LIST is a comma-separated list of columns to be included in `df`’s
output and therefore effectively controls the order of output columns.
Each field can thus be used at the place of choice, but yet must only be
used once.

Valid field names in the `field_list` are:

‘`source`’  
The source of the mount point, usually a device.

‘`fstype`’  
File system type.

‘`itotal`’  
Total number of inodes.

‘`iused`’  
Number of used inodes.

‘`iavail`’  
Number of available inodes.

‘`ipcent`’  
Percentage of `iused` divided by `itotal`.

‘`size`’  
Total number of blocks.

‘`used`’  
Number of used blocks.

‘`avail`’  
Number of available blocks.

‘`pcent`’  
Percentage of `used` divided by `size`.

‘`file`’  
The file name if specified on the command line.

‘`target`’  
The mount point.

The fields for block and inodes statistics are affected by the scaling
options like `-h` as usual.

The definition of the `field_list` can even be split among several
`--output` uses.

<div class="example">

``` example
#!/bin/sh
# Print the TARGET (i.e., the mount point) along with their percentage
# statistic regarding the blocks and the inodes.
df --out=target --output=pcent,ipcent

# Print all available fields.
df --o
```

id="index-output-format_002c-portable"></span>

Use the POSIX output format. This is like the default format except for
the following:

1.  The information about each file system is always printed on exactly
    one line; a mount device is never put on a line by itself. This
    means that if the mount device name is more than 20 characters long
    (e.g., for some network mounts), the columns are misaligned.
2.  The labels in the header output line are changed to conform to
    POSIX.
3.  The default block size and output format are unaffected by the
    `DF_BLOCK_SIZE`, `BLOCK_SIZE` and `BLOCKSIZE` environment variables.
    However, the default block size is still affected by
    `POSIXLY_CORRECT`: it is 512 if `POSIXLY_CORRECT` is set, 1024
    otherwise. See [Block size](#Block-size).

‘`--si`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dsi-2"></span> <span
id="index-SI-output-2"></span>

Append an SI-style abbreviation to each size, such as ‘`M`’ for
megabytes. Powers of 1000 are used, not 1024; ‘`M`’ stands for 1,000,000
bytes. This option is equivalent to `--block-size=si`. Use the `-h` or
`--human-readable` option if you prefer powers of 1024.

‘`--sync`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dsync"></span> <span
id="index-file-system-space_002c-retrieving-current-data-more-slowly"></span>

Invoke the `sync` system call before getting any usage data. On some
systems (notably Solaris), doing this yields more up to date results,
but in general this option makes `df` much slower, especially when there
are many or very busy file systems.

‘`--total`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dtotal"></span> <span
id="index-grand-total-of-file-system-size_002c-usage-and-available-space"></span>

Print a grand total of all arguments after all arguments have been
processed. This can be used to find out the total size, usage and
available space of all listed devices. If no arguments are specified df
will try harder to elide file systems insignificant to the total
available space, by suppressing duplicate remote file systems.

For the grand total line, `df` prints ‘`"total"`’ into the `source`
column, and ‘`"-"`’ into the `target` column. If there is no `source`
column (see `--output`), then `df` prints ‘`"total"`’ into the `target`
column, if present.

‘`-t fstype`’  
‘`--type=fstype`’  
<span id="index-_002dt-15"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dtype"></span> <span
id="index-file-system-types_002c-limiting-output-to-certain-1"></span>

Limit the listing to file systems of type `fstype`. Multiple file system
types can be specified by giving multiple `-t` options. By default,
nothing is omitted.

‘`-T`’  
‘`--print-type`’  
<span id="index-_002dT-9"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dprint_002dtype"></span> <span
id="index-file-system-types_002c-printing"></span>

Print each file system’s type. The types printed here are the same ones
you can include or exclude with `-t` and `-x`. The particular types
printed are whatever is supported by the system. Here are some of the
common names (this list is certainly not exhaustive):

‘`nfs`’  
<span id="index-NFS-file-system-type"></span>

An NFS file system, i.e., one mounted over a network from another
machine. This is the one type name which seems to be used uniformly by
all systems.

‘`ext2, ext3, ext4, xfs, btrfs…`’  
<span id="index-Linux-file-system-types"></span> <span
id="index-local-file-system-types"></span> <span
id="index-ext2-file-system-type"></span> <span
id="index-ext3-file-system-type"></span> <span
id="index-ext4-file-system-type"></span> <span
id="index-xfs-file-system-type"></span> <span
id="index-btrfs-file-system-type"></span>

A file system on a locally-mounted device. (The system might even
support more than one type here; GNU/Linux does.)

‘`iso9660, cdfs`’  
<span id="index-CD_002dROM-file-system-type"></span> <span
id="index-DVD-file-system-type"></span> <span
id="index-ISO9660-file-system-type"></span> <span
id="index-iso9660-file-system-type"></span> <span
id="index-cdfs-file-system-type"></span>

A file system on a CD or DVD drive. HP-UX uses ‘`cdfs`’, most other
systems use ‘`iso9660`’.

‘`ntfs,fat`’  
<span id="index-NTFS-file-system"></span> <span
id="index-DOS-file-system"></span> <span
id="index-MS_002dDOS-file-system"></span> <span
id="index-MS_002dWindows-file-system"></span> <span
id="index-ntfs-file-system-file"></span> <span
id="index-fat-file-system-file"></span>

File systems used by MS-Windows / MS-DOS.

‘`-x fstype`’  
‘`--exclude-type=fstype`’  
<span id="index-_002dx-5"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dexclude_002dtype"></span>

Limit the listing to file systems not of type `fstype`. Multiple file
system types can be eliminated by giving multiple `-x` options. By
default, no file system types are omitted.

‘`-v`’  
Ignored; for compatibility with System V versions of `df`.

`df` is installed only on systems that have usable mount tables, so
portable scripts should not rely on its existence.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure. Failure includes the case where no output is generated, so you
can inspect the exit status of a command like
‘`df -t ext3 -t reiserfs dir`’ to test whether `dir` is on a file system
of type ‘`ext3`’ or ‘`reiserfs`’.

Since the list of file systems (`mtab`) is needed to determine the file
system type, failure includes the cases when that list cannot be read
and one or more of the options `-a`, `-l`, `-t` or `-x` is used together
with a file name argument.

<span id="du_003a-Estimate-file-space-usage"></span>

### 14.2 `du`: Estimate file space usage

<span id="index-du"></span> <span id="index-file-space-usage"></span>
<span id="index-disk-usage-for-files"></span>

`du` reports the amount of file system space used by the set of
specified files and for each subdirectory (of directory arguments).
Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
du [option]… [file]…
```

</div>

With no arguments, `du` reports the file system space for the current
directory. Normally the space is printed in units of 1024 bytes, but
this can be overridden (see [Block size](#Block-size)). Non-integer
quantities are rounded up to the next higher unit.

If two or more hard links point to the same file, only one of the hard
links is counted. The `file` argument order affects which links are
counted, and changing the argument order may change the numbers and
entries that `du` outputs.

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`-0`’  
‘`--null`’  
<span id="index-_002d0"></span> <span id="index-_002d_002dnull"></span>
<span id="index-output-NUL_002dbyte_002dterminated-lines-3"></span>

Output a zero byte (ASCII NUL) at the end of each line, rather than a
newline. This option enables other programs to parse the output even
when that output would contain data with embedded newlines.

‘`-a`’  
‘`--all`’  
<span id="index-_002da-10"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dall-3"></span>

Show counts for all files, not just directories.

‘`--apparent-size`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dapparent_002dsize"></span>

Print apparent sizes, rather than file system usage. The apparent size
of a file is the number of bytes reported by `wc -c` on regular files,
or more generally, `ls -l --block-size=1` or `stat --format=%s`. For
example, a file containing the word ‘`zoo`’ with no newline would, of
course, have an apparent size of 3. Such a small file may require
anywhere from 0 to 16 KiB or more of file system space, depending on the
type and configuration of the file system on which the file resides.
However, a sparse file created with this command:

<div class="example">

``` example
dd bs=1 seek=2GiB if=/dev/null of=big
```

</div>

has an apparent size of 2 GiB, yet on most modern file systems, it
actually uses almost no space.

‘`-B size`’  
‘`--block-size=size`’  
<span id="index-_002dB-2"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dblock_002dsize-2"></span> <span
id="index-file-sizes"></span>

Scale sizes by `size` before printing them (see [Block
size](#Block-size)). For example, `-BG` prints sizes in units of
1,073,741,824 bytes.

‘`-b`’  
‘`--bytes`’  
<span id="index-_002db-18"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dbytes-6"></span>

Equivalent to `--apparent-size --block-size=1`.

‘`-c`’  
‘`--total`’  
<span id="index-_002dc-19"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dtotal-1"></span> <span
id="index-grand-total-of-file-system-space"></span>

Print a grand total of all arguments after all arguments have been
processed. This can be used to find out the total file system usage of a
given set of files or directories.

‘`-D`’  
‘`--dereference-args`’  
<span id="index-_002dD-3"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002ddereference_002dargs"></span>

Dereference symbolic links that are command line arguments. Does not
affect other symbolic links. This is helpful for finding out the file
system usage of directories, such as `/usr/tmp`, which are often
symbolic links.

‘`-d depth`’  
‘`--max-depth=depth`’  
<span id="index-_002dd-depth"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dmax_002ddepth_003ddepth"></span> <span
id="index-limiting-output-of-du"></span>

Show the total for each directory (and file if –all) that is at most
MAX_DEPTH levels down from the root of the hierarchy. The root is at
level 0, so `du --max-depth=0` is equivalent to `du -s`.

‘`--files0-from=file`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dfiles0_002dfrom_003dfile-2"></span>

Disallow processing files named on the command line, and instead process
those named in file `file`; each name being terminated by a zero byte
(ASCII NUL). This is useful when the list of file names is so long that
it may exceed a command line length limitation. In such cases, running
`du` via `xargs` is undesirable because it splits the list into pieces
and makes `du` print with the `--total` (`-c`) option for each sublist
rather than for the entire list. One way to produce a list of ASCII NUL
terminated file names is with GNU `find`, using its `-print0` predicate.
If `file` is ‘`-`’ then the ASCII NUL terminated file names are read
from standard input.

‘`-H`’  
<span id="index-_002dH-6"></span>

Equivalent to `--dereference-args` (`-D`).

‘`-h`’  
‘`--human-readable`’  
<span id="index-_002dh-9"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dhuman_002dreadable-3"></span> <span
id="index-human_002dreadable-output-3"></span>

Append a size letter to each size, such as ‘`M`’ for mebibytes. Powers
of 1024 are used, not 1000; ‘`M`’ stands for 1,048,576 bytes. This
option is equivalent to `--block-size=human-readable`. Use the `--si`
option if you prefer powers of 1000.

‘`--inodes`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dinodes-1"></span> <span
id="index-inode-usage_002c-dereferencing-in-du"></span>

List inode usage information instead of block usage. This option is
useful for finding directories which contain many files, and therefore
eat up most of the inodes space of a file system (see `df`, option
`--inodes`). It can well be combined with the options `-a`, `-c`, `-h`,
`-l`, `-s`, `-S`, `-t` and `-x`; however, passing other options
regarding the block size, for example `-b`, `-m` and `--apparent-size`,
is ignored.

‘`-k`’  
<span id="index-_002dk-5"></span> <span
id="index-kibibytes-for-file-sizes"></span>

Print sizes in 1024-byte blocks, overriding the default block size (see
[Block size](#Block-size)). This option is equivalent to
`--block-size=1K`.

‘`-L`’  
‘`--dereference`’  
<span id="index-_002dL-7"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002ddereference-4"></span> <span
id="index-symbolic-links_002c-dereferencing-in-du"></span>

Dereference symbolic links (show the file system space used by the file
or directory that the link points to instead of the space used by the
link).

‘`-l`’  
‘`--count-links`’  
<span id="index-_002dl-9"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dcount_002dlinks"></span> <span
id="index-hard-links_002c-counting-in-du"></span>

Count the size of all files, even if they have appeared already (as a
hard link).

‘`-m`’  
<span id="index-_002dm-10"></span> <span
id="index-mebibytes-for-file-sizes"></span>

Print sizes in 1,048,576-byte blocks, overriding the default block size
(see [Block size](#Block-size)). This option is equivalent to
`--block-size=1M`.

‘`-P`’  
‘`--no-dereference`’  
<span id="index-_002dP-6"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dno_002ddereference-5"></span> <span
id="index-symbolic-links_002c-dereferencing-in-du-1"></span>

For each symbolic link encountered by `du`, consider the file system
space used by the symbolic link itself.

‘`-S`’  
‘`--separate-dirs`’  
<span id="index-_002dS-10"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dseparate_002ddirs"></span>

Normally, in the output of `du` (when not using `--summarize`), the size
listed next to a directory name, `d`, represents the sum of sizes of all
entries beneath `d` as well as the size of `d` itself. With
`--separate-dirs`, the size reported for a directory name, `d`, will
exclude the size of any subdirectories.

‘`--si`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dsi-3"></span> <span
id="index-SI-output-3"></span>

Append an SI-style abbreviation to each size, such as ‘`M`’ for
megabytes. Powers of 1000 are used, not 1024; ‘`M`’ stands for 1,000,000
bytes. This option is equivalent to `--block-size=si`. Use the `-h` or
`--human-readable` option if you prefer powers of 1024.

‘`-s`’  
‘`--summarize`’  
<span id="index-_002ds-20"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dsummarize"></span>

Display only a total for each argument.

‘`-t size`’  
‘`--threshold=size`’  
<span id="index-_002dt-16"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dthreshold"></span>

Exclude entries based on a given `size`. The `size` refers to used
blocks in normal mode (see [Block size](#Block-size)), or inodes count
in conjunction with the `--inodes` option.

If `size` is positive, then `du` will only print entries with a size
greater than or equal to that.

If `size` is negative, then `du` will only print entries with a size
smaller than or equal to that.

Although GNU `find` can be used to find files of a certain size, `du`’s
`--threshold` option can be used to also filter directories based on a
given size.

Please note that the `--threshold` option can be combined with the
`--apparent-size` option, and in this case would elide entries based on
its apparent size.

Please note that the `--threshold` option can be combined with the
`--inodes` option, and in this case would elide entries based on its
inodes count.

Here’s how you would use `--threshold` to find directories with a size
greater than or equal to 200 megabytes:

<div class="example">

``` example
du --threshold=200MB
```

</div>

Here’s how you would use `--threshold` to find directories and files -
note the `-a` - with an apparent size smaller than or equal to 500
bytes:

<div class="example">

``` example
du -a -t -500 --apparent-size
```

</div>

Here’s how you would use `--threshold` to find directories on the root
file system with more than 20000 inodes used in the directory tree
below:

<div class="example">

``` example
du --inodes -x --threshold=20000 /
```

</div>

‘`--time`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dtime-5"></span> <span
id="index-last-modified-dates_002c-displaying-in-du"></span>

Show the most recent modification timestamp (mtime) of any file in the
directory, or any of its subdirectories. See [File
timestamps](#File-timestamps).

‘`--time=ctime`’  
‘`--time=status`’  
‘`--time=use`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dtime-6"></span> <span
id="index-ctime_002c-show-the-most-recent"></span> <span
id="index-status-time_002c-show-the-most-recent"></span> <span
id="index-use-time_002c-show-the-most-recent"></span>

Show the most recent status change timestamp (ctime) of any file in the
directory, or any of its subdirectories. See [File
timestamps](#File-timestamps).

‘`--time=atime`’  
‘`--time=access`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dtime-7"></span> <span
id="index-atime_002c-show-the-most-recent"></span> <span
id="index-access-timestamp_002c-show-the-most-recent"></span>

Show the most recent access timestamp (atime) of any file in the
directory, or any of its subdirectories. See [File
timestamps](#File-timestamps).

‘`--time-style=style`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dtime_002dstyle-1"></span> <span
id="index-time-style-1"></span>

List timestamps in style `style`. This option has an effect only if the
`--time` option is also specified. The `style` should be one of the
following:

‘`+format`’  
<span id="index-LC_005fTIME-5"></span>

List timestamps using `format`, where `format` is interpreted like the
format argument of `date` (see [date invocation](#date-invocation)). For
example, `--time-style="+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"` causes `du` to list
timestamps like ‘`2020-07-21 23:45:56`’. As with `date`, `format`’s
interpretation is affected by the `LC_TIME` locale category.

‘`full-iso`’  
List timestamps in full using ISO 8601-like date, time, and time zone
components with nanosecond precision, e.g.,
‘`2020-07-21 23:45:56.477817180 -0400`’. This style is equivalent to
‘`+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%N %z`’.

‘`long-iso`’  
List ISO 8601 date and time components with minute precision, e.g.,
‘`2020-07-21 23:45`’. These timestamps are shorter than ‘`full-iso`’
timestamps, and are usually good enough for everyday work. This style is
equivalent to ‘`+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M`’.

‘`iso`’  
List ISO 8601 dates for timestamps, e.g., ‘`2020-07-21`’. This style is
equivalent to ‘`+%Y-%m-%d`’.

<span id="index-TIME_005fSTYLE-1"></span>

You can specify the default value of the `--time-style` option with the
environment variable `TIME_STYLE`; if `TIME_STYLE` is not set the
default style is ‘`long-iso`’. For compatibility with `ls`, if
`TIME_STYLE` begins with ‘`+`’ and contains a newline, the newline and
any later characters are ignored; if `TIME_STYLE` begins with ‘`posix-`’
the ‘`posix-`’ is ignored; and if `TIME_STYLE` is ‘`locale`’ it is
ignored.

‘`-X file`’  
‘`--exclude-from=file`’  
<span id="index-_002dX-file"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dexclude_002dfrom_003dfile"></span> <span
id="index-excluding-files-from-du"></span>

Like `--exclude`, except take the patterns to exclude from `file`, one
per line. If `file` is ‘`-`’, take the patterns from standard input.

‘`--exclude=pattern`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dexclude_003dpattern"></span> <span
id="index-excluding-files-from-du-1"></span>

When recursing, skip subdirectories or files matching `pattern`. For
example, `du --exclude='*.o'` excludes files whose names end in ‘`.o`’.

‘`-x`’  
‘`--one-file-system`’  
<span id="index-_002dx-6"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002done_002dfile_002dsystem-2"></span> <span
id="index-one-file-system_002c-restricting-du-to"></span>

Skip directories that are on different file systems from the one that
the argument being processed is on.

<span id="index-NFS-mounts-from-BSD-to-HP_002dUX-1"></span>

On BSD systems, `du` reports sizes that are half the correct values for
files that are NFS-mounted from HP-UX systems. On HP-UX systems, it
reports sizes that are twice the correct values for files that are
NFS-mounted from BSD systems. This is due to a flaw in HP-UX; it also
affects the HP-UX `du` program.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

### 14.3 `stat`: Report file or file system status

<span id="index-stat"></span> <span id="index-file-status"></span> <span
id="index-file-system-status"></span>

`stat` displays information about the specified file(s). Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
stat [option]… [file]…
```

</div>

With no option, `stat` reports all information about the given files.
But it also can be used to report the information of the file systems
the given files are located on. If the files are links, `stat` can also
give information about the files the links point to.

<span id="index-conflicts-with-shell-built_002dins-1"></span> <span
id="index-built_002din-shell-commands_002c-conflicts-with-1"></span>

Due to shell aliases and built-in `stat` functions, using an unadorned
`stat` interactively or in a script may get you different functionality
than that described here. Invoke it via `env` (i.e., `env stat …`) to
avoid interference from the shell.

‘`-L`’  
‘`--dereference`’  
<span id="index-_002dL-8"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002ddereference-5"></span> <span
id="index-symbolic-links_002c-dereferencing-in-stat"></span>

Change how `stat` treats symbolic links. With this option, `stat` acts
on the file referenced by each symbolic link argument. Without it,
`stat` acts on any symbolic link argument directly.

‘`-f`’  
‘`--file-system`’  
<span id="index-_002df-20"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dfile_002dsystem"></span> <span
id="index-file-systems"></span>

Report information about the file systems where the given files are
located instead of information about the files themselves. This option
implies the `-L` option.

‘`--cached=mode`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dcached_003dmode"></span> <span
id="index-attribute-caching"></span>

Control how attributes are read from the file system; if supported by
the system. This allows one to control the trade-off between freshness
and efficiency of attribute access, especially useful with remote file
systems. `mode` can be:

‘`always`’  
Always read the already cached attributes if available.

‘`never`’  
Always sychronize with the latest file system attributes. This also
mounts automounted files.

‘`default`’  
Leave the caching behavior to the underlying file system.

‘`-c`’  
‘`--format=format`’  
<span id="index-_002dc-20"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dformat_003dformat"></span> <span
id="index-output-format"></span>

Use `format` rather than the default format. `format` is automatically
newline-terminated, so running a command like the following with two or
more `file` operands produces a line of output for each operand:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ stat --format=%d:%i / /usr
2050:2
2057:2
```

</div>

‘`--printf=format`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dprintf_003dformat"></span> <span
id="index-output-format-1"></span>

Use `format` rather than the default format. Like `--format`, but
interpret backslash escapes, and do not output a mandatory trailing
newline. If you want a newline, include ‘`\n`’ in the `format`. Here’s
how you would use `--printf` to print the device and inode numbers of
`/` and `/usr`:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ stat --printf='%d:%i\n' / /usr
2050:2
2057:2
```

</div>

‘`-t`’  
‘`--terse`’  
<span id="index-_002dt-17"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dterse"></span> <span id="index-terse-output"></span>

Print the information in terse form, suitable for parsing by other
programs.

The output of the following commands are identical and the `--format`
also identifies the items printed (in fuller form) in the default
format. Note the format string would include another ‘`%C`’ at the end
with an active SELinux security context.

<div class="example">

``` example
$ stat --format="%n %s %b %f %u %g %D %i %h %t %T %X %Y %Z %W %o" ...
$ stat --terse ...
```

</div>

The same illustrating terse output in `--file-system` mode:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ stat -f --format="%n %i %l %t %s %S %b %f %a %c %d" ...
$ stat -f --terse ...
```

</div>

The valid `format` directives for files with `--format` and `--printf`
are:

-   %a - Permission bits in octal (note ‘`#`’ and ‘`0`’ printf flags)
-   %A - Permission bits in symbolic form (similar to `ls -ld`)
-   %b - Number of blocks allocated (see ‘`%B`’)
-   %B - The size in bytes of each block reported by ‘`%b`’
-   %C - The SELinux security context of a file, if available
-   %d - Device number in decimal (st_dev)
-   %D - Device number in hex (st_dev)
-   %Hd - Major device number in decimal
-   %Ld - Minor device number in decimal
-   %f - Raw mode in hex
-   %F - File type
-   %g - Group ID of owner
-   %G - Group name of owner
-   %h - Number of hard links
-   %i - Inode number
-   %m - Mount point (See note below)
-   %n - File name
-   %N - Quoted file name with dereference if symbolic link (see below)
-   %o - Optimal I/O transfer size hint
-   %s - Total size, in bytes
-   %r - Device type in decimal (st_rdev)
-   %R - Device type in hex (st_rdev)
-   %Hr - Major device type in decimal (see below)
-   %Lr - Minor device type in decimal (see below)
-   %t - Major device type in hex (see below)
-   %T - Minor device type in hex (see below)
-   %u - User ID of owner
-   %U - User name of owner
-   %w - Time of file birth, or ‘`-`’ if unknown
-   %W - Time of file birth as seconds since Epoch, or ‘`0`’
-   %x - Time of last access
-   %X - Time of last access as seconds since Epoch
-   %y - Time of last data modification
-   %Y - Time of last data modification as seconds since Epoch
-   %z - Time of last status change
-   %Z - Time of last status change as seconds since Epoch

The ‘`%a`’ format prints the octal mode, and so it is useful to control
the zero padding of the output with the ‘`#`’ and ‘`0`’ printf flags.
For example to pad to at least 3 wide while making larger numbers
unambiguously octal, you can use ‘`%#03a`’.

The ‘`%N`’ format can be set with the environment variable
`QUOTING_STYLE`. If that environment variable is not set, the default
value is ‘`shell-escape-always`’. Valid quoting styles are:

‘`literal`’  
Output strings as-is; this is the same as the `--literal` (`-N`) option.

‘`shell`’  
Quote strings for the shell if they contain shell metacharacters or
would cause ambiguous output. The quoting is suitable for
POSIX-compatible shells like `bash`, but it does not always work for
incompatible shells like `csh`.

‘`shell-always`’  
Quote strings for the shell, even if they would normally not require
quoting.

‘`shell-escape`’  
Like ‘`shell`’, but also quoting non-printable characters using the
POSIX proposed ‘`$''`’ syntax suitable for most shells.

‘`shell-escape-always`’  
Like ‘`shell-escape`’, but quote strings even if they would normally not
require quoting.

‘`c`’  
Quote strings as for C character string literals, including the
surrounding double-quote characters; this is the same as the
`--quote-name` (`-Q`) option.

‘`escape`’  
Quote strings as for C character string literals, except omit the
surrounding double-quote characters; this is the same as the `--escape`
(`-b`) option.

‘`clocale`’  
Quote strings as for C character string literals, except use surrounding
quotation marks appropriate for the locale.

‘`locale`’  
Quote strings as for C character string literals, except use surrounding
quotation marks appropriate for the locale, and quote 'like this'
instead of "like this" in the default C locale. This looks nicer on many
displays.

The ‘`r`’, ‘`R`’, ‘`%t`’, and ‘`%T`’ formats operate on the st_rdev
member of the stat(2) structure, i.e., the represented device rather
than the containing device, and so are only defined for character and
block special files. On some systems or file types, st_rdev may be used
to represent other quantities.

The ‘`%W`’, ‘`%X`’, ‘`%Y`’, and ‘`%Z`’ formats accept a precision
preceded by a period to specify the number of digits to print after the
decimal point. For example, ‘`%.3X`’ outputs the access timestamp to
millisecond precision. If a period is given but no precision, `stat`
uses 9 digits, so ‘`%.X`’ is equivalent to ‘`%.9X`’. When discarding
excess precision, timestamps are truncated toward minus infinity.

<div class="example">

``` example
zero pad:
  $ stat -c '[%015Y]' /usr
  [000001288929712]
space align:
  $ stat -c '[%15Y]' /usr
  [     1288929712]
  $ stat -c '[%-15Y]' /usr
  [1288929712     ]
precision:
  $ stat -c '[%.3Y]' /usr
  [1288929712.114]
  $ stat -c '[%.Y]' /usr
  [1288929712.114951834]
```

</div>

The mount point printed by ‘`%m`’ is similar to that output by `df`,
except that:

-   stat does not dereference symlinks by default (unless `-L` is
    specified)
-   stat does not search for specified device nodes in the file system
    list, instead operating on them directly
-   <span id="index-bind-mount-1"></span> stat outputs the alias for a
    bind mounted file, rather than the initial mount point of its
    backing device. One can recursively call stat until there is no
    change in output, to get the current base mount point

When listing file system information (`--file-system` (`-f`)), you must
use a different set of `format` directives:

-   %a - Free blocks available to non-super-user
-   %b - Total data blocks in file system
-   %c - Total file nodes in file system
-   %d - Free file nodes in file system
-   %f - Free blocks in file system
-   %i - File System ID in hex
-   %l - Maximum length of file names
-   %n - File name
-   %s - Block size (for faster transfers)
-   %S - Fundamental block size (for block counts)
-   %t - Type in hex
-   %T - Type in human readable form

<span id="index-TZ-3"></span>

Timestamps are listed according to the time zone rules specified by the
`TZ` environment variable, or by the system default rules if `TZ` is not
set. See [Specifying the Time Zone with
`TZ`](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_mono/libc.html#TZ-Variable)
in The GNU C Library Reference Manual.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

### 14.4 `sync`: Synchronize cached writes to persistent storage

<span id="index-sync-1"></span> <span
id="index-synchronize-file-system-and-memory"></span> <span
id="index-Synchronize-cached-writes-to-persistent-storage"></span>

`sync` synchronizes in memory files or file systems to persistent
storage. Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
sync [option] [file]…
```

</div>

<span id="index-superblock_002c-writing"></span> <span
id="index-inodes_002c-written-buffered"></span>

`sync` writes any data buffered in memory out to the storage device.
This can include (but is not limited to) modified superblocks, modified
inodes, and delayed reads and writes. This must be implemented by the
kernel; The `sync` program does nothing but exercise the `sync`,
`syncfs`, `fsync`, and `fdatasync` system calls.

<span id="index-crashes-and-corruption"></span>

The kernel keeps data in memory to avoid doing (relatively slow) device
reads and writes. This improves performance, but if the computer
crashes, data may be lost or the file system corrupted as a result. The
`sync` command instructs the kernel to write data in memory to
persistent storage.

If any argument is specified then only those files will be synchronized
using the fsync(2) syscall by default.

If at least one file is specified, it is possible to change the
synchronization method with the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`-d`’  
‘`--data`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002ddata"></span>

Use fdatasync(2) to sync only the data for the file, and any metadata
required to maintain file system consistency.

‘`-f`’  
‘`--file-system`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dfile_002dsystem-1"></span>

Synchronize all the I/O waiting for the file systems that contain the
file, using the syscall syncfs(2). Note you would usually *not* specify
this option if passing a device node like ‘`/dev/sda`’ for example, as
that would sync the containing file system rather than the referenced
one. Note also that depending on the system, passing individual device
nodes or files may have different sync characteristics than using no
arguments. I.e., arguments passed to fsync(2) may provide greater
guarantees through write barriers, than a global sync(2) used when no
arguments are provided.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

### 14.5 `truncate`: Shrink or extend the size of a file

<span id="index-truncate"></span> <span
id="index-truncating_002c-file-sizes"></span>

`truncate` shrinks or extends the size of each `file` to the specified
size. Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
truncate option… file…
```

</div>

<span id="index-files_002c-creating"></span>

Any `file` that does not exist is created.

<span id="index-sparse-files_002c-creating"></span> <span
id="index-holes_002c-creating-files-with"></span>

If a `file` is larger than the specified size, the extra data is lost.
If a `file` is shorter, it is extended and the sparse extended part (or
hole) reads as zero bytes.

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`-c`’  
‘`--no-create`’  
<span id="index-_002dc-21"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dno_002dcreate-1"></span>

Do not create files that do not exist.

‘`-o`’  
‘`--io-blocks`’  
<span id="index-_002do-7"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dio_002dblocks"></span>

Treat `size` as number of I/O blocks of the `file` rather than bytes.

‘`-r rfile`’  
‘`--reference=rfile`’  
<span id="index-_002dr-11"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dreference-4"></span>

Base the size of each `file` on the size of `rfile`.

‘`-s size`’  
‘`--size=size`’  
<span id="index-_002ds-21"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dsize-1"></span>

Set or adjust the size of each `file` according to `size`. `size` is in
bytes unless `--io-blocks` is specified. `size` may be, or may be an
integer optionally followed by, one of the following multiplicative
suffixes:

<div class="example">

``` example
‘KB’ =>           1000 (KiloBytes)
‘K’  =>           1024 (KibiBytes)
‘MB’ =>      1000*1000 (MegaBytes)
‘M’  =>      1024*1024 (MebiBytes)
‘GB’ => 1000*1000*1000 (GigaBytes)
‘G’  => 1024*1024*1024 (GibiBytes)
```

</div>

and so on for ‘`T`’, ‘`P`’, ‘`E`’, ‘`Z`’, and ‘`Y`’. Binary prefixes can
be used, too: ‘`KiB`’=‘`K`’, ‘`MiB`’=‘`M`’, and so on.

`size` may also be prefixed by one of the following to adjust the size
of each `file` based on its current size:

<div class="example">

``` example
‘+’  => extend by
‘-’  => reduce by
‘<’  => at most
‘>’  => at least
‘/’  => round down to multiple of
‘%’  => round up to multiple of
```

failure.

### 15.1 `echo`: Print a line of text

<span id="index-echo-1"></span> <span id="index-displaying-text"></span>
<span id="index-printing-text"></span> <span
id="index-text_002c-displaying"></span> <span
id="index-arbitrary-text_002c-displaying"></span>

`echo` writes each given `string` to standard output, with a space
between each and a newline after the last one. Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
echo [option]… [string]…
```

</div>

<span id="index-conflicts-with-shell-built_002dins-2"></span> <span
id="index-built_002din-shell-commands_002c-conflicts-with-2"></span>

Due to shell aliases and built-in `echo` functions, using an unadorned
`echo` interactively or in a script may get you different functionality
than that described here. Invoke it via `env` (i.e., `env echo …`) to
avoid interference from the shell.

Due to historical and backwards compatibility reasons, certain bare
option-like strings cannot be passed to `echo` as non-option arguments.
It is therefore not advisable to use `echo` for printing unknown or
variable arguments. The `printf` command is recommended as a more
portable and flexible replacement for tasks historically performed by
`echo`. See [printf invocation](#printf-invocation).

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options). Options must precede operands, and the
normally-special argument ‘`--`’ has no special meaning and is treated
like any other `string`.

‘`-n`’  
<span id="index-_002dn-15"></span>

Do not output the trailing newline.

‘`-e`’  
<span id="index-_002de-5"></span> <span
id="index-backslash-escapes-1"></span>

Enable interpretation of the following backslash-escaped characters in
each `string`:

‘`\a`’  
alert (bell)

‘`\b`’  
backspace

‘`\c`’  
produce no further output

‘`\e`’  
escape

‘`\f`’  
form feed

‘`\n`’  
newline

‘`\r`’  
carriage return

‘`\t`’  
horizontal tab

‘`\v`’  
vertical tab

‘`\\`’  
backslash

‘`\0nnn`’  
the eight-bit value that is the octal number `nnn` (zero to three octal
digits), if `nnn` is a nine-bit value, the ninth bit is ignored

‘`\nnn`’  
the eight-bit value that is the octal number `nnn` (one to three octal
digits), if `nnn` is a nine-bit value, the ninth bit is ignored

‘`\xhh`’  
the eight-bit value that is the hexadecimal number `hh` (one or two
hexadecimal digits)

‘`-E`’  
<span id="index-_002dE-1"></span> <span
id="index-backslash-escapes-2"></span>

Disable interpretation of backslash escapes in each `string`. This is
the default. If `-e` and `-E` are both specified, the last one given
takes effect.

<span id="index-POSIXLY_005fCORRECT-6"></span>

If the `POSIXLY_CORRECT` environment variable is set, then when `echo`’s
first argument is not `-n` it outputs option-like arguments instead of
treating them as options. For example, `echo -ne hello` outputs
‘`-ne hello`’ instead of plain ‘`hello`’. Also backslash escapes are
always enabled. Note to echo the string ‘`-n`’, one of the characters
can be escaped in either octal or hexadecimal representation. For
example, `echo -e '\x2dn'`.

POSIX does not require support for any options, and says that the
behavior of `echo` is implementation-defined if any `string` contains a
backslash or if the first argument is `-n`. Portable programs should use
the `printf` command instead. See [printf
invocation](#printf-invocation).

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

### 15.2 `printf`: Format and print data

<span id="index-printf"></span>

`printf` does formatted printing of text. Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
printf format [argument]…
```

</div>

`printf` prints the `format` string, interpreting ‘`%`’ directives and
‘`\`’ escapes to format numeric and string arguments in a way that is
mostly similar to the C ‘`printf`’ function. See [`printf` format
directives](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_mono/libc.html#Output-Conversion-Syntax)
in The GNU C Library Reference Manual, for details. The differences are
listed below.

<span id="index-conflicts-with-shell-built_002dins-3"></span> <span
id="index-built_002din-shell-commands_002c-conflicts-with-3"></span>

Due to shell aliases and built-in `printf` functions, using an unadorned
`printf` interactively or in a script may get you different
functionality than that described here. Invoke it via `env` (i.e.,
`env printf …`) to avoid interference from the shell.

-   The `format` argument is reused as necessary to convert all the
    given `argument`s. For example, the command ‘`printf %s a b`’
    outputs ‘`ab`’.
-   Missing `argument`s are treated as null strings or as zeros,
    depending on whether the context expects a string or a number. For
    example, the command ‘`printf %sx%d`’ prints ‘`x0`’.
-   <span id="index-_005cc"></span> An additional escape, ‘`\c`’, causes
    `printf` to produce no further output. For example, the command
    ‘`printf 'A%sC\cD%sF' B E`’ prints ‘`ABC`’.
-   The hexadecimal escape sequence ‘`\xhh`’ has at most two digits, as
    opposed to C where it can have an unlimited number of digits. For
    example, the command ‘`printf '\x07e'`’ prints two bytes, whereas
    the C statement ‘`printf ("\x07e")`’ prints just one.
-   <span id="index-_0025b"></span> An additional directive ‘`%b`’,
    prints its argument string with ‘`\`’ escapes interpreted in the
    same way as in the `format` string, except that octal escapes are of
    the form ‘`\0ooo`’ where `ooo` is 0 to 3 octal digits. If ‘`\ooo`’
    is nine-bit value, ignore the ninth bit. If a precision is also
    given, it limits the number of bytes printed from the converted
    string.
-   <span id="index-_0025q"></span> An additional directive ‘`%q`’,
    prints its argument string in a format that can be reused as input
    by most shells. Non-printable characters are escaped with the POSIX
    proposed ‘`$''`’ syntax, and shell metacharacters are quoted
    appropriately. This is an equivalent format to
    `ls --quoting=shell-escape` output.
-   Numeric arguments must be single C constants, possibly with leading
    ‘`+`’ or ‘`-`’. For example, ‘`printf %.4d -3`’ outputs ‘`-0003`’.
-   <span id="index-POSIXLY_005fCORRECT-7"></span> If the leading
    character of a numeric argument is ‘`"`’ or ‘`'`’ then its value is
    the numeric value of the immediately following character. Any
    remaining characters are silently ignored if the `POSIXLY_CORRECT`
    environment variable is set; otherwise, a warning is printed. For
    example, ‘`printf "%d" "'a"`’ outputs ‘`97`’ on hosts that use the
    ASCII character set, since ‘`a`’ has the numeric value 97 in ASCII.

<span id="index-LC_005fNUMERIC-5"></span>

A floating point argument is interpreted according to the `LC_NUMERIC`
category of either the current or the C locale, and is printed according
to the current locale. For example, in a locale whose decimal point
character is a comma, the command ‘`printf '%g %g' 2,5 2.5`’ outputs
‘`2,5 2,5`’. See [Floating point](#Floating-point).

<span id="index-_005cooo"></span> <span id="index-_005cxhh"></span>

`printf` interprets ‘`\ooo`’ in `format` as an octal number (if `ooo` is
1 to 3 octal digits) specifying a byte to print, and ‘`\xhh`’ as a
hexadecimal number (if `hh` is 1 to 2 hex digits) specifying a character
to print. Note however that when ‘`\ooo`’ specifies a number larger than
255, `printf` ignores the ninth bit. For example, ‘`printf '\400'`’ is
equivalent to ‘`printf '\0'`’.

<span id="index-_005cuhhhh"></span> <span
id="index-_005cUhhhhhhhh"></span> <span id="index-Unicode"></span> <span
id="index-ISO_002fIEC-10646"></span> <span
id="index-LC_005fCTYPE-4"></span>

`printf` interprets two character syntaxes introduced in ISO C 99:
‘`\u`’ for 16-bit Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646) characters, specified as four
hexadecimal digits `hhhh`, and ‘`\U`’ for 32-bit Unicode characters,
specified as eight hexadecimal digits `hhhhhhhh`. `printf` outputs the
Unicode characters according to the `LC_CTYPE` locale. Unicode
characters in the ranges U+0000…U+009F, U+D800…U+DFFF cannot be
specified by this syntax, except for U+0024 ($), U+0040 (@), and U+0060
()\`.

The processing of ‘`\u`’ and ‘`\U`’ requires a full-featured `iconv`
facility. It is activated on systems with glibc 2.2 (or newer), or when
`libiconv` is installed prior to this package. Otherwise ‘`\u`’ and
‘`\U`’ will print as-is.

The only options are a lone `--help` or `--version`. See [Common
options](#Common-options). Options must precede operands.

The Unicode character syntaxes are useful for writing strings in a
locale independent way. For example, a string containing the Euro
currency symbol

<div class="example">

``` example
$ env printf '\u20AC 14.95'
```

</div>

will be output correctly in all locales supporting the Euro symbol
(ISO-8859-15, UTF-8, and others). Similarly, a Chinese string

<div class="example">

``` example
$ env printf '\u4e2d\u6587'
```

</div>

will be output correctly in all Chinese locales (GB2312, BIG5, UTF-8,
etc).

Note that in these examples, the `printf` command has been invoked via
`env` to ensure that we run the program found via your shell’s search
path, and not a shell alias or a built-in function.

For larger strings, you don’t need to look up the hexadecimal code
values of each character one by one. ASCII characters mixed with \u
escape sequences is also known as the JAVA source file encoding. You can
use GNU recode 3.5c (or newer) to convert strings to this encoding. Here
is how to convert a piece of text into a shell script which will output
this text in a locale-independent way:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ LC_CTYPE=zh_CN.big5 /usr/local/bin/printf \
    '\u4e2d\u6587\n' > sample.txt
$ recode BIG5..JAVA < sample.txt \
    | sed -e "s|^|/usr/local/bin/printf '|" -e "s|$|\\\\n'|" \
    > sample.sh
```

</div>

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

### 15.3 `yes`: Print a string until interrupted

<span id="index-yes"></span> <span
id="index-repeated-output-of-a-string"></span>

`yes` prints the command line arguments, separated by spaces and
followed by a newline, forever until it is killed. If no arguments are
given, it prints ‘`y`’ followed by a newline forever until killed.

Upon a write error, `yes` exits with status ‘`1`’.

The only options are a lone `--help` or `--version`. To output an
argument that begins with ‘`-`’, precede it with `--`, e.g.,
‘`yes -- --help`’. See [Common options](#Common-options).

<span id="index-conditions"></span> <span

This section describes commands that are primarily useful for their exit
status, rather than their output. Thus, they are often used as the
condition of shell `if` statements, or as the last command in a
pipeline.

<span id="false_003a-Do-nothing_002c-unsuccessfully"></span>

### 16.1 `false`: Do nothing, unsuccessfully

<span id="index-false"></span> <span
id="index-do-nothing_002c-unsuccessfully"></span> <span
id="index-failure-exit-status"></span> <span
id="index-exit-status-of-false"></span>

`false` does nothing except return an exit status of 1, meaning
*failure*. It can be used as a place holder in shell scripts where an
unsuccessful command is needed. In most modern shells, `false` is a
built-in command, so when you use ‘`false`’ in a script, you’re probably
using the built-in command, not the one documented here.

`false` honors the `--help` and `--version` options.

This version of `false` is implemented as a C program, and is thus more
secure and faster than a shell script implementation, and may safely be
used as a dummy shell for the purpose of disabling accounts.

Note that `false` (unlike all other programs documented herein) exits
unsuccessfully, even when invoked with `--help` or `--version`.

Portable programs should not assume that the exit status of `false` is
1, as it is greater than 1 on some non-GNU hosts.

<span id="true_003a-Do-nothing_002c-successfully"></span>

### 16.2 `true`: Do nothing, successfully

<span id="index-true"></span> <span
id="index-do-nothing_002c-successfully"></span> <span
id="index-no_002dop"></span> <span id="index-successful-exit"></span>
<span id="index-exit-status-of-true"></span>

`true` does nothing except return an exit status of 0, meaning
*success*. It can be used as a place holder in shell scripts where a
successful command is needed, although the shell built-in command `:`
(colon) may do the same thing faster. In most modern shells, `true` is a
built-in command, so when you use ‘`true`’ in a script, you’re probably
using the built-in command, not the one documented here.

`true` honors the `--help` and `--version` options.

Note, however, that it is possible to cause `true` to exit with nonzero
status: with the `--help` or `--version` option, and with standard
output already closed or redirected to a file that evokes an I/O error.
For example, using a Bourne-compatible shell:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ ./true --version >&-
./true: write error: Bad file number
$ ./true --version > /dev/full
./true: write error: No space left on device
```

</div>

This version of `true` is implemented as a C program, and is thus more
secure and faster than a shell script implementation, and may safely be
used as a dummy shell for the purpose of disabling accounts.

<span id="test_003a-Check-file-types-and-compare-values"></span>

### 16.3 `test`: Check file types and compare values

<span id="index-test"></span> <span id="index-check-file-types"></span>
<span id="index-compare-values"></span> <span
id="index-expression-evaluation"></span>

`test` returns a status of 0 (true) or 1 (false) depending on the
evaluation of the conditional expression `expr`. Each part of the
expression must be a separate argument.

`test` has file status checks, string operators, and numeric comparison
operators.

`test` has an alternate form that uses opening and closing square
brackets instead a leading ‘`test`’. For example, instead of
‘`test -d /`’, you can write ‘`[ -d / ]`’. The square brackets must be
separate arguments; for example, ‘`[-d /]`’ does not have the desired
effect. Since ‘`test expr`’ and ‘`[ expr ]`’ have the same meaning, only
the former form is discussed below.

Synopses:

<div class="example">

``` example
test expression
test
[ expression ]
[ ]
[ option
```

</div>

<span id="index-conflicts-with-shell-built_002dins-4"></span> <span
id="index-built_002din-shell-commands_002c-conflicts-with-4"></span>

Due to shell aliases and built-in `test` functions, using an unadorned
`test` interactively or in a script may get you different functionality
than that described here. Invoke it via `env` (i.e., `env test …`) to
avoid interference from the shell.

If `expression` is omitted, `test` returns false. If `expression` is a
single argument, `test` returns false if the argument is null and true
otherwise. The argument can be any string, including strings like
‘`-d`’, ‘`-1`’, ‘`--`’, ‘`--help`’, and ‘`--version`’ that most other
programs would treat as options. To get help and version information,
invoke the commands ‘`[ --help`’ and ‘`[ --version`’, without the usual
closing brackets. See [Common options](#Common-options).

<span id="Numeric-tests-1"></span>

#### 16.3.5 Numeric tests

<span id="index-numeric-tests"></span> <span
id="index-arithmetic-tests"></span>

Numeric relational operators. The arguments must be entirely numeric
(possibly negative), or the special expression `-l string`, which
evaluates to the length of `string`.

‘`arg1 -eq arg2`’  
‘`arg1 -ne arg2`’  
‘`arg1 -lt arg2`’  
‘`arg1 -le arg2`’  
‘`arg1 -gt arg2`’

id="index-_002dlt"></span> <span id="index-_002dle"></span> <span
id="index-_002dgt"></span> <span id="index-_002dge"></span>

These arithmetic binary operators return true if `arg1` is equal,
not-equal, less-than, less-than-or-equal, greater-than, or
greater-than-or-equal than `arg2`, respectively.

For example:

<div class="example">

``` example
test -1 -gt -2 && echo yes
⇒ yes
test -l abc -gt 1 && echo yes
⇒ yes
test 0x100 -eq 1
error→ test: integer expression expected before -eq

#### 16.3.6 Connectives for `test`

<span id="index-logical-connectives"></span> <span
id="index-connectives_002c-logical"></span>

Note it’s preferred to use shell logical primitives rather than these
logical connectives internal to `test`, because an expression may become
ambiguous depending on the expansion of its parameters.

For example, this becomes ambiguous when ‘`$1`’ is set to ‘`'!'`’ and
‘`$2`’ to the empty string ‘`''`’:

<div class="example">

``` example
test "$1" -a "$2"
```

</div>

and should be written as:

<div class="example">

``` example
test "$1" && test "$2"
```

</div>

Note the shell logical primitives also benefit from short circuit
operation, which can be significant for file attribute tests.

‘`! expr`’  
<span id="index-_0021"></span>

True if `expr` is false. ‘`!`’ has lower precedence than all parts of
`expr`. Note ‘`!`’ needs to be specified to the left of a binary
expression, I.e., ‘`'!' 1 -gt 2`’ rather than ‘`1 '!' -gt 2`’. Also
‘`!`’ is often a shell special character and is best used quoted.

‘`expr1 -a expr2`’  
<span id="index-_002da-11"></span> <span
id="index-logical-and-operator"></span> <span
id="index-and-operator"></span>

True if both `expr1` and `expr2` are true. ‘`-a`’ is left associative,
and has a higher precedence than ‘`-o`’.

<span id="index-_002do-8"></span> <span

### 16.4 `expr`: Evaluate expressions

<span id="index-expr"></span> <span
id="index-expression-evaluation-1"></span> <span
id="index-evaluation-of-expressions"></span>

`expr` evaluates an expression and writes the result on standard output.
Each token of the expression must be a separate argument.

Operands are either integers or strings. Integers consist of one or more
decimal digits, with an optional leading ‘`-`’. `expr` converts anything
appearing in an operand position to an integer or a string depending on
the operation being applied to it.

Strings are not quoted for `expr` itself, though you may need to quote
them to protect characters with special meaning to the shell, e.g.,
spaces. However, regardless of whether it is quoted, a string operand
should not be a parenthesis or any of `expr`’s operators like `+`, so
you cannot safely pass an arbitrary string `$str` to expr merely by
quoting it to the shell. One way to work around this is to use the GNU
extension `+`, (e.g., `+ "$str" = foo`); a more portable way is to use
`" $str"` and to adjust the rest of the expression to take the leading
space into account (e.g., `" $str" = " foo"`).

You should not pass a negative integer or a string with leading ‘`-`’ as
`expr`’s first argument, as it might be misinterpreted as an option;
this can be avoided by parenthesization. Also, portable scripts should
not use a string operand that happens to take the form of an integer;
this can be worked around by inserting leading spaces as mentioned
above.

<span id="index-parentheses-for-grouping"></span>

Operators may be given as infix symbols or prefix keywords. Parentheses
may be used for grouping in the usual manner. You must quote parentheses
and many operators to avoid the shell evaluating them, however.

Because `expr` uses multiple-precision arithmetic, it works with
integers wider than those of machine registers.

The only options are `--help` and `--version`. See [Common
options](#Common-options). Options must precede operands.

<span id="index-exit-status-of-expr"></span>

Exit status:

<div class="display">

``` display
0 if the expression is neither null nor 0,
1 if the expression is null or 0,
2 if the expression is invalid,
3 if an internal error occurred (e.g., arithmetic overflow).
```

#### 16.4.1 String expressions

<span id="index-string-expressions"></span> <span
id="index-expressions_002c-string"></span>

`expr` supports pattern matching and other string operators. These have
higher precedence than both the numeric and relational operators (in the
next sections).

‘`string : regex`’  
<span id="index-pattern-matching"></span> <span
id="index-regular-expression-matching"></span> <span
id="index-matching-patterns"></span>

Perform pattern matching. The arguments are converted to strings and the
second is considered to be a (basic, a la GNU `grep`) regular
expression, with a `^` implicitly prepended. The first argument is then
matched against this regular expression.

If `regex` does not use ‘`\(`’ and ‘`\)`’, the `:` expression returns
the number of characters matched, or 0 if the match fails.

If `regex` uses ‘`\(`’ and ‘`\)`’, the `:` expression returns the part
of `string` that matched the subexpression, or the null string if the
match failed or the subexpression did not contribute to the match.

<span id="index-_005c_0028-regexp-operator"></span>

Only the first ‘`\( … \)`’ pair is relevant to the return value;
additional pairs are meaningful only for grouping the regular expression
operators.

<span id="index-_005c_002b-regexp-operator"></span> <span
id="index-_005c_003f-regexp-operator"></span> <span
id="index-_005c_007c-regexp-operator"></span>

In the regular expression, `\+`, `\?`, and `\|` are operators which
respectively match one or more, zero or one, or separate alternatives.
These operators are GNU extensions. See [Regular
Expressions](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/manual/grep.html#Regular-Expressions)
in The GNU Grep Manual, for details of regular expression syntax. Some
examples are in [Examples of expr](#Examples-of-expr).

‘`match string regex`’  
<span id="index-match"></span>

An alternative way to do pattern matching. This is the same as
‘`string : regex`’.

‘`substr string position length`’  
<span id="index-substr"></span>

Returns the substring of `string` beginning at `position` with length at
most `length`. If either `position` or `length` is negative, zero, or
non-numeric, returns the null string.

‘`index string charset`’  
<span id="index-index"></span>

Returns the first position in `string` where the first character in
`charset` was found. If no character in `charset` is found in `string`,
return 0.

‘`length string`’  
<span id="index-length"></span>

Returns the length of `string`.

‘`+ token`’  
<span id="index-_002b"></span>

Interpret `token` as a string, even if it is a keyword like `match` or
an operator like `/`. This makes it possible to test
`expr length + "$x"` or `expr + "$x" : '.*/\(.\)'` and have it do the
right thing even if the value of `$x` happens to be (for example) `/` or
`index`. This operator is a GNU extension. Portable shell scripts should
use `" $token" : ' \(.*\)'` instead of `+ "$token"`.

To make `expr` interpret keywords as strings, you must use the `quote`
operator.

#### 16.4.2 Numeric expressions

<span id="index-numeric-expressions"></span> <span
id="index-expressions_002c-numeric"></span>

`expr` supports the usual numeric operators, in order of increasing
precedence. These numeric operators have lower precedence than the
string operators described in the previous section, and higher
precedence than the connectives (next section).

‘`+ -`’  
<span id="index-_002b-1"></span> <span id="index-_002d"></span> <span
id="index-addition"></span> <span id="index-subtraction"></span>

Addition and subtraction. Both arguments are converted to integers; an
error occurs if this cannot be done.

‘`* / %`’  
<span id="index-_002a"></span> <span id="index-_002f"></span> <span
id="index-_0025"></span> <span id="index-multiplication"></span> <span
id="index-division"></span> <span id="index-remainder"></span>

Multiplication, division, remainder. Both arguments are converted to
integers; an error occurs if this cannot be done.

<span id="index-connectives_002c-logical-1"></span> <span
id="index-logical-connectives-1"></span> <span
id="index-relations_002c-numeric-or-string"></span>

`expr` supports the usual logical connectives and relations. These have
lower precedence than the string and numeric operators (previous
sections). Here is the list, lowest-precedence operator first.

‘`|`’  
<span id="index-_007c"></span> <span
id="index-logical-or-operator-1"></span> <span
id="index-or-operator-1"></span>

Returns its first argument if that is neither null nor zero, otherwise
its second argument if it is neither null nor zero, otherwise 0. It does
not evaluate its second argument if its first argument is neither null
nor zero.

‘`&`’  
<span id="index-_0026"></span> <span
id="index-logical-and-operator-1"></span> <span
id="index-and-operator-1"></span>

Return its first argument if neither argument is null or zero,
otherwise 0. It does not evaluate its second argument if its first
argument is null or zero.

‘`< <= = == != >= >`’  
<span id="index-_003c"></span> <span id="index-_003c_003d"></span> <span
id="index-_003d"></span> <span id="index-_003d_003d"></span> <span
id="index-_003e"></span> <span id="index-_003e_003d"></span> <span
id="index-comparison-operators"></span> <span
id="index-LC_005fCOLLATE-4"></span>

Compare the arguments and return 1 if the relation is true, 0 otherwise.
`==` is a synonym for `=`. `expr` first tries to convert both arguments
to integers and do a numeric comparison; if either conversion fails, it
does a lexicographic comparison using the character collating sequence
specified by the `LC_COLLATE` locale.

<span id="index-examples-of-expr"></span>

Here are a few examples, including quoting for shell metacharacters.

To add 1 to the shell variable `foo`, in Bourne-compatible shells:

<div class="example">

``` example
foo=$(expr $foo + 1)
```

</div>

To print the non-directory part of the file name stored in `$fname`,
which need not contain a `/`:

<div class="example">

``` example
expr $fname : '.*/\(.*\)' '|' $fname
```

</div>

An example showing that `\+` is an operator:

<div class="example">

``` example
expr aaa : 'a\+'
⇒ 3
```

</div>

<div class="example">

``` example
expr abc : 'a\(.\)c'
⇒ b
expr index abcdef cz
⇒ 3
expr index index a
error→ expr: syntax error
expr index + index a
⇒ 0

## 17 Redirection

<span id="index-redirection"></span> <span
id="index-commands-for-redirection"></span>

Unix shells commonly provide several forms of *redirection*—ways to
change the input source or output destination of a command. But one
useful redirection is performed by a separate command, not by the shell;
it’s described here.

|                                                              |     |                                                 |

<span

### 17.1 `tee`: Redirect output to multiple files or processes

<span id="index-tee"></span> <span id="index-pipe-fitting"></span> <span
id="index-destinations_002c-multiple-output"></span> <span
id="index-read-from-standard-input-and-write-to-standard-output-and-files"></span>

The `tee` command copies standard input to standard output and also to
any files given as arguments. This is useful when you want not only to
send some data down a pipe, but also to save a copy. Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
tee [option]… [file]…
```

</div>

If a file being written to does not already exist, it is created. If a
file being written to already exists, the data it previously contained
is overwritten unless the `-a` option is used.

In previous versions of GNU Coreutils (v5.3.0 – v8.23), a `file` of
‘`-`’ caused `tee` to send another copy of input to standard output.
However, as the interleaved output was not very useful, `tee` now
conforms to POSIX and treats ‘`-`’ as a file name.

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`-a`’  
‘`--append`’  
<span id="index-_002da-12"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dappend"></span>

Append standard input to the given files rather than overwriting them.

‘`-i`’  
‘`--ignore-interrupts`’  
<span id="index-_002di-16"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dignore_002dinterrupts"></span>

Ignore interrupt signals.

‘`-p`’  
‘`--output-error[=mode]`’  
<span id="index-_002dp-8"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002doutput_002derror"></span>

Adjust the behavior with errors on the outputs, with the long form
option supporting selection between the following `mode`s:

‘`warn`’  
Warn on error opening or writing any output, including pipes. Writing is
continued to still open files/pipes. Exit status indicates failure if
any output has an error.

‘`warn-nopipe`’  
This is the default `mode` when not specified, or when the short form
`-p` is used. Warn on error opening or writing any output, except pipes.
Writing is continued to still open files/pipes. Exit status indicates
failure if any non pipe output had an error.

‘`exit`’  
Exit on error opening or writing any output, including pipes.

‘`exit-nopipe`’  
Exit on error opening or writing any output, except pipes.

The `tee` command is useful when you happen to be transferring a large
amount of data and also want to summarize that data without reading it a
second time. For example, when you are downloading a DVD image, you
often want to verify its signature or checksum right away. The
inefficient way to do it is simply:

<div class="example">

``` example
wget https://example.com/some.iso && sha1sum some.iso
```

</div>

One problem with the above is that it makes you wait for the download to
complete before starting the time-consuming SHA1 computation. Perhaps
even more importantly, the above requires reading the DVD image a second
time (the first was from the network).

The efficient way to do it is to interleave the download and SHA1
computation. Then, you’ll get the checksum for free, because the entire
process parallelizes so well:

<div class="example">

``` example
# slightly contrived, to demonstrate process substitution
wget -O - https://example.com/dvd.iso \
  | tee >(sha1sum > dvd.sha1) > dvd.iso
```

</div>

That makes `tee` write not just to the expected output file, but also to
a pipe running `sha1sum` and saving the final checksum in a file named
`dvd.sha1`.

Note, however, that this example relies on a feature of modern shells
called *process substitution* (the ‘`>(command)`’ syntax, above; See
[Process
Substitution](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Process-Substitution)
in The Bash Reference Manual.), so it works with `zsh`, `bash`, and
`ksh`, but not with `/bin/sh`. So if you write code like this in a shell
script, be sure to start the script with ‘`#!/bin/bash`’.

Note also that if any of the process substitutions (or piped standard
output) might exit early without consuming all the data, the `-p` option
is needed to allow `tee` to continue to process the input to any
remaining outputs.

Since the above example writes to one file and one process, a more
conventional and portable use of `tee` is even better:

<div class="example">

``` example
wget -O - https://example.com/dvd.iso \
  | tee dvd.iso | sha1sum > dvd.sha1
```

</div>

You can extend this example to make `tee` write to two processes,
computing MD5 and SHA1 checksums in parallel. In this case, process
substitution is required:

<div class="example">

``` example
wget -O - https://example.com/dvd.iso \
  | tee >(sha1sum > dvd.sha1) \
        >(md5sum > dvd.md5) \
  > dvd.iso
```

</div>

This technique is also useful when you want to make a *compressed* copy
of the contents of a pipe. Consider a tool to graphically summarize file
system usage data from ‘`du -ak`’. For a large hierarchy, ‘`du -ak`’ can
run for a long time, and can easily produce terabytes of data, so you
won’t want to rerun the command unnecessarily. Nor will you want to save
the uncompressed output.

Doing it the inefficient way, you can’t even start the GUI until after
you’ve compressed all of the `du` output:

<div class="example">

``` example
du -ak | gzip -9 > /tmp/du.gz
gzip -d /tmp/du.gz | checkspace -a
```

</div>

With `tee` and process substitution, you start the GUI right away and
eliminate the decompression completely:

<div class="example">

``` example
du -ak | tee >(gzip -9 > /tmp/du.gz) | checkspace -a
```

</div>

Finally, if you regularly create more than one type of compressed
tarball at once, for example when `make dist` creates both
`gzip`-compressed and `bzip2`-compressed tarballs, there may be a better
way. Typical `automake`-generated `Makefile` rules create the two
compressed tar archives with commands in sequence, like this (slightly
simplified):

<div class="example">

``` example
tardir=your-pkg-M.N
tar chof - "$tardir" | gzip  -9 -c > your-pkg-M.N.tar.gz
tar chof - "$tardir" | bzip2 -9 -c > your-pkg-M.N.tar.bz2
```

</div>

However, if the hierarchy you are archiving and compressing is larger
than a couple megabytes, and especially if you are using a
multi-processor system with plenty of memory, then you can do much
better by reading the directory contents only once and running the
compression programs in parallel:

<div class="example">

``` example
tardir=your-pkg-M.N
tar chof - "$tardir" \
  | tee >(gzip -9 -c > your-pkg-M.N.tar.gz) \
  | bzip2 -9 -c > your-pkg-M.N.tar.bz2
```

</div>

If you want to further process the output from process substitutions,
and those processes write atomically (i.e., write less than the system’s
PIPE_BUF size at a time), that’s possible with a construct like:

<div class="example">

``` example
tardir=your-pkg-M.N
tar chof - "$tardir" \
  | tee >(md5sum --tag) > >(sha256sum --tag) \
  | sort | gpg --clearsign > your-pkg-M.N.tar.sig
```

</div>

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

### 18.1 `basename`: Strip directory and suffix from a file name

<span id="index-basename"></span> <span
id="index-strip-directory-and-suffix-from-file-names"></span> <span
id="index-directory_002c-stripping-from-file-names"></span> <span

id="index-file-names_002c-stripping-directory-and-suffix"></span> <span
id="index-leading-directory-components_002c-stripping"></span>

`basename` removes any leading directory components from `name`.
Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
basename name [suffix]
basename option… name…
```

</div>

If `suffix` is specified and is identical to the end of `name`, it is
removed from `name` as well. Note that since trailing slashes are
removed prior to suffix matching, `suffix` will do nothing if it
contains slashes. `basename` prints the result on standard output.

Together, `basename` and `dirname` are designed such that if
‘`ls "$name"`’ succeeds, then the command sequence
‘`cd "$(dirname "$name")"; ls "$(basename "$name")"`’ will, too. This
works for everything except file names containing a trailing newline.

POSIX allows the implementation to define the results if `name` is empty
or ‘`//`’. In the former case, GNU `basename` returns the empty string.
In the latter case, the result is ‘`//`’ on platforms where `//` is
distinct from `/`, and ‘`/`’ on platforms where there is no difference.

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options). Options must precede operands.

‘`-a`’  
‘`--multiple`’  
<span id="index-_002da-13"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dmultiple"></span>

id="index-_002d_002dsuffix-5"></span>

Remove a trailing `suffix`. This option implies the `-a` option.

‘`-z`’  
‘`--zero`’  
<span id="index-_002dz-14"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dzero-4"></span> <span
id="index-output-NUL_002dbyte_002dterminated-lines-4"></span>

Output a zero byte (ASCII NUL) at the end of each line, rather than a
newline. This option enables other programs to parse the output even
when that output would contain data with embedded newlines.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

Examples:

<div class="example">

``` example
# Output "sort".
basename /usr/bin/sort

# Output "stdio".
basename include/stdio.h .h

# Output "stdio".
basename -s .h include/stdio.h

# Output "stdio" followed by "stdlib"
basename -a -s .h include/stdio.h include/stdlib.h
```

### 18.2 `dirname`: Strip last file name component

<span id="index-dirname"></span> <span
id="index-directory-components_002c-printing"></span> <span
id="index-stripping-non_002ddirectory-suffix"></span> <span
id="index-non_002ddirectory-suffix_002c-stripping"></span>

`dirname` prints all but the final slash-delimited component of each
`name`. Slashes on either side of the final component are also removed.
If the string contains no slash, `dirname` prints ‘`.`’ (meaning the
current directory). Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
dirname [option] name…
```

</div>

`name` need not be a file name, but if it is, this operation effectively
lists the directory that contains the final component, including the
case when the final component is itself a directory.

Together, `basename` and `dirname` are designed such that if
‘`ls "$name"`’ succeeds, then the command sequence
‘`cd "$(dirname "$name")"; ls "$(basename "$name")"`’ will, too. This
works for everything except file names containing a trailing newline.

POSIX allows the implementation to define the results if `name` is
‘`//`’. With GNU `dirname`, the result is ‘`//`’ on platforms where `//`
is distinct from `/`, and ‘`/`’ on platforms where there is no
difference.

The program accepts the following option. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`-z`’  
‘`--zero`’  
<span id="index-_002dz-15"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dzero-5"></span> <span
id="index-output-NUL_002dbyte_002dterminated-lines-5"></span>

Output a zero byte (ASCII NUL) at the end of each line, rather than a
newline. This option enables other programs to parse the output even
when that output would contain data with embedded newlines.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

Examples:

<div class="example">

``` example
# Output "/usr/bin".
dirname /usr/bin/sort
dirname /usr/bin//.//

# Output "dir1" followed by "dir2"
dirname dir1/str dir2/str

<span id="index-valid-file-names_002c-checking-for"></span> <span

`pathchk` checks validity and portability of file names. Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
pathchk [option]… name…
```

</div>

For each `name`, `pathchk` prints an error message if any of these
conditions is true:

1.  One of the existing directories in `name` does not have search
    (execute) permission,
2.  The length of `name` is larger than the maximum supported by the
    operating system.
3.  The length of one component of `name` is longer than its file
    system’s maximum.

A nonexistent `name` is not an error, so long as a file with that name
could be created under the above conditions.

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options). Options must precede operands.

‘`-p`’  
<span id="index-_002dp-9"></span>

Instead of performing checks based on the underlying file system, print
an error message if any of these conditions is true:

1.  A file name is empty.
2.  A file name contains a character outside the POSIX portable file
    name character set, namely, the ASCII letters and digits, ‘`.`’,
    ‘`_`’, ‘`-`’, and ‘`/`’.
3.  The length of a file name or one of its components exceeds the POSIX
    minimum limits for portability.

‘`-P`’  
<span id="index-_002dP-7"></span>

Print an error message if a file name is empty, or if it contains a
component that begins with ‘`-`’.

‘`--portability`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dportability-1"></span>

Print an error message if a file name is not portable to all POSIX
hosts. This option is equivalent to ‘`-p -P`’.

### 18.4 `mktemp`: Create temporary file or directory

<span id="index-mktemp"></span> <span
id="index-file-names_002c-creating-temporary"></span> <span
id="index-directory_002c-creating-temporary"></span> <span
id="index-temporary-files-and-directories"></span>

`mktemp` manages the creation of temporary files and directories.
Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
mktemp [option]… [template]
```

</div>

Safely create a temporary file or directory based on `template`, and
print its name. If given, `template` must include at least three
consecutive ‘`X`’s in the last component. If omitted, the template
‘`tmp.XXXXXXXXXX`’ is used, and option `--tmpdir` is implied. The final
run of ‘`X`’s in the `template` will be replaced by alpha-numeric
characters; thus, on a case-sensitive file system, and with a `template`
including a run of `n` instances of ‘`X`’, there are ‘`62**n`’ potential
file names.

Older scripts used to create temporary files by simply joining the name
of the program with the process id (‘`$$`’) as a suffix. However, that
naming scheme is easily predictable, and suffers from a race condition
where the attacker can create an appropriately named symbolic link, such
that when the script then opens a handle to what it thought was an
unused file, it is instead modifying an existing file. Using the same
scheme to create a directory is slightly safer, since the `mkdir` will
fail if the target already exists, but it is still inferior because it
allows for denial of service attacks. Therefore, modern scripts should
use the `mktemp` command to guarantee that the generated name will be
unpredictable, and that knowledge of the temporary file name implies
that the file was created by the current script and cannot be modified
by other users.

When creating a file, the resulting file has read and write permissions
for the current user, but no permissions for the group or others; these
permissions are reduced if the current umask is more restrictive.

Here are some examples (although note that if you repeat them, you will
most likely get different file names):

-   Create a temporary file in the current directory.
    <div class="example">

    ``` example
    $ mktemp file.XXXX
    file.H47c
    ```

    </div>
-   Create a temporary file with a known suffix.
    <div class="example">

    ``` example
    $ mktemp --suffix=.txt file-XXXX
    file-H08W.txt
    $ mktemp file-XXXX-XXXX.txt
    file-XXXX-eI9L.txt
    ```

    </div>
-   Create a secure fifo relative to the user’s choice of `TMPDIR`, but
    falling back to the current directory rather than `/tmp`. Note that
    `mktemp` does not create fifos, but can create a secure directory in
    which the fifo can live. Exit the shell if the directory or fifo
    could not be created.
    <div class="example">

    ``` example
    $ dir=$(mktemp -p "${TMPDIR:-.}" -d dir-XXXX) || exit 1
    $ fifo=$dir/fifo
    $ mkfifo "$fifo" || { rmdir "$dir"; exit 1; }
    ```

    </div>
-   Create and use a temporary file if possible, but ignore failure. The
    file will reside in the directory named by `TMPDIR`, if specified,
    or else in `/tmp`.
    <div class="example">

    ``` example
    $ file=$(mktemp -q) && {
    >   # Safe to use $file only within this block.  Use quotes,
    >   # since $TMPDIR, and thus $file, may contain whitespace.
    >   echo ... > "$file"
    >   rm "$file"
    > }
    ```

    </div>
-   Act as a semi-random character generator (it is not fully random,
    since it is impacted by the contents of the current directory). To
    avoid security holes, do not use the resulting names to create a
    file.
    <div class="example">

    ``` example
    $ mktemp -u XXX
    Gb9
    $ mktemp -u XXX
    nzC
    ```

    </div>

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`-d`’  
‘`--directory`’  
<span id="index-_002dd-17"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002ddirectory-3"></span>

Create a directory rather than a file. The directory will have read,
write, and search permissions for the current user, but no permissions
for the group or others; these permissions are reduced if the current
umask is more restrictive.

‘`-q`’  
‘`--quiet`’  
<span id="index-_002dq-5"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dquiet-8"></span>

Suppress diagnostics about failure to create a file or directory. The
exit status will still reflect whether a file was created.

‘`-u`’  
‘`--dry-run`’  
<span id="index-_002du-10"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002ddry_002drun"></span>

Generate a temporary name that does not name an existing file, without
changing the file system contents. Using the output of this command to
create a new file is inherently unsafe, as there is a window of time
between generating the name and using it where another process can
create an object by the same name.

‘`-p dir`’  
‘`--tmpdir[=dir]`’  
<span id="index-_002dp-10"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dtmpdir"></span>

Treat `template` relative to the directory `dir`. If `dir` is not
specified (only possible with the long option `--tmpdir`) or is the
empty string, use the value of `TMPDIR` if available, otherwise use
‘`/tmp`’. If this is specified, `template` must not be absolute.
However, `template` can still contain slashes, although intermediate
directories must already exist.

‘`--suffix=suffix`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dsuffix-6"></span>

Append `suffix` to the `template`. `suffix` must not contain slash. If
`--suffix` is specified, `template` must end in ‘`X`’; if it is not
specified, then an appropriate `--suffix` is inferred by finding the
last ‘`X`’ in `template`. This option exists for use with the default
`template` and for the creation of a `suffix` that starts with ‘`X`’.

‘`-t`’  
<span id="index-_002dt-19"></span>

Treat `template` as a single file relative to the value of `TMPDIR` if
available, or to the directory specified by `-p`, otherwise to ‘`/tmp`’.
`template` must not contain slashes. This option is deprecated; the use
of `-p` without `-t` offers better defaults (by favoring the command
line over `TMPDIR`) and more flexibility (by allowing intermediate
directories).

`realpath` expands all symbolic links and resolves references to
‘`/./`’, ‘`/../`’ and extra ‘`/`’ characters. By default, all but the
last component of the specified files must exist. Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
realpath [option]… file…
```

</div>

The file name canonicalization functionality overlaps with that of the
`readlink` command. This is the preferred command for canonicalization
as it’s a more suitable and standard name. In addition this command
supports relative file name processing functionality.

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`-e`’  
‘`--canonicalize-existing`’  
<span id="index-_002de-7"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dcanonicalize_002dexisting-1"></span>

Ensure that all components of the specified file names exist. If any
component is missing or unavailable, `realpath` will output a diagnostic
unless the `-q` option is specified, and exit with a nonzero exit code.
A trailing slash requires that the name resolve to a directory.

‘`-m`’  
‘`--canonicalize-missing`’  
<span id="index-_002dm-11"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dcanonicalize_002dmissing-1"></span>

If any component of a specified file name is missing or unavailable,
treat it as a directory.

‘`-L`’  
‘`--logical`’  
<span id="index-_002dL-10"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dlogical-1"></span>

Symbolic links are resolved in the specified file names, but they are
resolved after any subsequent ‘`..`’ components are processed.

‘`-P`’  
‘`--physical`’  
<span id="index-_002dP-8"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dphysical-1"></span>

Symbolic links are resolved in the specified file names, and they are
resolved before any subsequent ‘`..`’ components are processed. This is
the default mode of operation.

‘`-q`’  
‘`--quiet`’  
<span id="index-_002dq-6"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dquiet-9"></span>

Suppress diagnostic messages for specified file names.

‘`--relative-to=dir`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002drelative_002dto"></span> <span
id="index-relpath"></span>

Print the resolved file names relative to the specified directory. Note
this option honors the `-m` and `-e` options pertaining to file
existence.

‘`--relative-base=dir`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002drelative_002dbase"></span>

Print the resolved file names as relative *if* the files are descendants
of `dir`. Otherwise, print the resolved file names as absolute. Note
this option honors the `-m` and `-e` options pertaining to file
existence. For details about combining `--relative-to` and
`--relative-base`, see [Realpath usage
examples](#Realpath-usage-examples).

‘`-s`’  
‘`--strip`’  
‘`--no-symlinks`’  
<span id="index-_002ds-24"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dstrip-1"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dno_002dsymlinks"></span>

Do not resolve symbolic links. Only resolve references to ‘`/./`’,
‘`/../`’ and remove extra ‘`/`’ characters. When combined with the `-m`
option, realpath operates only on the file name, and does not touch any
actual file.

‘`-z`’  
‘`--zero`’  
<span id="index-_002dz-16"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dzero-6"></span> <span
id="index-output-NUL_002dbyte_002dterminated-lines-6"></span>

Output a zero byte (ASCII NUL) at the end of each line, rather than a

<span id="index-_002d_002drelative_002dto-1"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002drelative_002dbase-1"></span>

By default, `realpath` prints the absolute file name of given files
(symlinks are resolved, `words` is resolved to `american-english`):

<div class="example">

``` example
cd /home/user
realpath /usr/bin/sort /tmp/foo /usr/share/dict/words 1.txt
⇒ /usr/bin/sort
⇒ /tmp/foo
⇒ /usr/share/dict/american-english
⇒ /home/user/1.txt
```

</div>

With `--relative-to`, file names are printed relative to the given
directory:

<div class="example">

``` example
realpath --relative-to=/usr/bin \
         /usr/bin/sort /tmp/foo /usr/share/dict/words 1.txt
⇒ sort
⇒ ../../tmp/foo
⇒ ../share/dict/american-english
⇒ ../../home/user/1.txt
```

</div>

With `--relative-base`, relative file names are printed *if* the
resolved file name is below the given base directory. For files outside
the base directory absolute file names are printed:

<div class="example">

``` example
realpath --relative-base=/usr \
         /usr/bin/sort /tmp/foo /usr/share/dict/words 1.txt
⇒ bin/sort
⇒ /tmp/foo
⇒ share/dict/american-english
⇒ /home/user/1.txt
```

</div>

When both `--relative-to=DIR1` and `--relative-base=DIR2` are used, file
names are printed relative to `dir1` *if* they are located below `dir2`.
If the files are not below `dir2`, they are printed as absolute file
names:

<div class="example">

``` example
realpath --relative-to=/usr/bin --relative-base=/usr \
         /usr/bin/sort /tmp/foo /usr/share/dict/words 1.txt
⇒ sort
⇒ /tmp/foo
⇒ ../share/dict/american-english
⇒ /home/user/1.txt
```

</div>

When both `--relative-to=DIR1` and `--relative-base=DIR2` are used,
`dir1` *must* be a subdirectory of `dir2`. Otherwise, `realpath` prints
absolutes file names.

id="index-print-name-of-current-directory"></span> <span
id="index-current-working-directory_002c-printing"></span> <span
id="index-working-directory_002c-printing"></span>

`pwd` prints the name of the current directory. Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
pwd [option]…
```

</div>

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`-L`’  
‘`--logical`’  
<span id="index-_002dL-11"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dlogical-2"></span>

If the contents of the environment variable `PWD` provide an absolute
name of the current directory with no ‘`.`’ or ‘`..`’ components, but
possibly with symbolic links, then output those contents. Otherwise,
fall back to default `-P` handling.

‘`-P`’  
‘`--physical`’  
<span id="index-_002dP-9"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dphysical-2"></span>

Print a fully resolved name for the current directory. That is, all
components of the printed name will be actual directory names—none will
be symbolic links.

<span id="index-symbolic-links-and-pwd"></span>

If `-L` and `-P` are both given, the last one takes precedence. If
neither option is given, then this implementation uses `-P` as the
default unless the `POSIXLY_CORRECT` environment variable is set.

Due to shell aliases and built-in `pwd` functions, using an unadorned
`pwd` interactively or in a script may get you different functionality
than that described here. Invoke it via `env` (i.e., `env pwd …`) to
avoid interference from the shell.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

### 19.2 `stty`: Print or change terminal characteristics

<span id="index-stty"></span> <span
id="index-change-or-print-terminal-settings"></span> <span
id="index-terminal-settings"></span> <span
id="index-line-settings-of-terminal"></span>

`stty` prints or changes terminal characteristics, such as baud rate.
Synopses:

<div class="example">

``` example
stty [option] [setting]…
stty [option]
```

</div>

If given no line settings, `stty` prints the baud rate, line discipline
number (on systems that support it), and line settings that have been
changed from the values set by ‘`stty sane`’. By default, mode reading
and setting are performed on the tty line connected to standard input,
although this can be modified by the `--file` option.

`stty` accepts many non-option arguments that change aspects of the
terminal line operation, as described below.

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`-a`’  
‘`--all`’  
<span id="index-_002da-14"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dall-4"></span>

Print all current settings in human-readable form. This option may not
be used in combination with any line settings.

‘`-F device`’  
‘`--file=device`’  
<span id="index-_002dF-5"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dfile"></span>

Set the line opened by the file name specified in `device` instead of
the tty line connected to standard input. This option is necessary
because opening a POSIX tty requires use of the `O_NONDELAY` flag to
prevent a POSIX tty from blocking until the carrier detect line is high
if the `clocal` flag is not set. Hence, it is not always possible to
allow the shell to open the device in the traditional manner.

‘`-g`’  
‘`--save`’  
<span id="index-_002dg-6"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dsave"></span> <span
id="index-machine_002dreadable-stty-output"></span>

Print all current settings in a form that can be used as an argument to
another `stty` command to restore the current settings. This option may
not be used in combination with any line settings.

Many settings can be turned off by preceding them with a ‘`-`’. Such
arguments are marked below with “May be negated” in their description.
The descriptions themselves refer to the positive case, that is, when
*not* negated (unless stated otherwise, of course).

Some settings are not available on all POSIX systems, since they use
extensions. Such arguments are marked below with “Non-POSIX” in their
description. On non-POSIX systems, those or other settings also may not
be available, but it’s not feasible to document all the variations: just
try it and see.

`stty` is installed only on platforms with the POSIX terminal interface,
so portable scripts should not rely on its existence on non-POSIX
platforms.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

<span id="Special-characters"></span>

#### 19.2.6 Special characters

<span id="index-special-characters"></span> <span
id="index-characters_002c-special"></span>

The special characters’ default values vary from system to system. They
are set with the syntax ‘`name value`’, where the names are listed below
and the value can be given either literally, in hat notation (‘`^c`’),
or as an integer which may start with ‘`0x`’ to indicate hexadecimal,
‘`0`’ to indicate octal, or any other digit to indicate decimal.

<span id="index-disabling-special-characters"></span> <span
id="index-u_002c-and-disabling-special-characters"></span>

For GNU stty, giving a value of `^-` or `undef` disables that special
character. (This is incompatible with Ultrix `stty`, which uses a value
of ‘`u`’ to disable a special character. GNU `stty` treats a value ‘`u`’
like any other, namely to set that special character to U.)

‘`intr`’  
<span id="index-intr"></span>

Send an interrupt signal.

‘`quit`’  
<span id="index-quit"></span>

Send a quit signal.

‘`erase`’  
<span id="index-erase"></span>

Erase the last character typed.

‘`kill`’  
<span id="index-kill"></span>

Erase the current line.

‘`eof`’  
<span id="index-eof"></span>

Send an end of file (terminate the input).

‘`eol`’  
<span id="index-eol"></span>

End the line.

‘`eol2`’  
<span id="index-eol2"></span>

Alternate character to end the line. Non-POSIX.

‘`discard`’  
<span id="index-discard"></span> <span id="index-flush"></span>

Alternate character to toggle discarding of output. Non-POSIX.

‘`swtch`’  
<span id="index-swtch"></span>

‘`status`’  
<span id="index-status-1"></span>

Send an info signal. Not currently supported on GNU/Linux. Non-POSIX.

‘`start`’  
<span id="index-start"></span>

‘`stop`’  
<span id="index-stop"></span>

Stop the output.

‘`susp`’  
<span id="index-susp"></span>

Send a terminal stop signal.

‘`dsusp`’  
<span id="index-dsusp"></span>

Send a terminal stop signal after flushing the input. Non-POSIX.

‘`rprnt`’  
<span id="index-rprnt"></span>

Redraw the current line. Non-POSIX.

‘`werase`’

#### 19.2.7 Special settings

<span id="index-special-settings"></span>

‘`min n`’  
<span id="index-min"></span>

Set the minimum number of characters that will satisfy a read until the
time value has expired, when `-icanon` is set.

‘`time n`’  
<span id="index-time-1"></span>

Set the number of tenths of a second before reads time out if the
minimum number of characters have not been read, when `-icanon` is set.

‘`ispeed n`’  
<span id="index-ispeed"></span>

Set the input speed to `n`.

‘`ospeed n`’  
<span id="index-ospeed"></span>

Set the output speed to `n`.

‘`rows n`’  
<span id="index-rows"></span>

Tell the tty kernel driver that the terminal has `n` rows. Non-POSIX.

‘`cols n`’  
‘`columns n`’  
<span id="index-cols"></span> <span id="index-columns"></span>

Tell the kernel that the terminal has `n` columns. Non-POSIX.

‘`drain`’  
<span id="index-drain"></span> <span
id="index-nonblocking-stty-setting"></span>

Apply settings after first waiting for pending output to be transmitted.
This is enabled by default for GNU `stty`. It is useful to disable this
option in cases where the system may be in a state where serial
transmission is not possible. For example, if the system has received
the ‘`DC3`’ character with `ixon` (software flow control) enabled, then
`stty` would block without `-drain` being specified. May be negated.
Non-POSIX.

‘`size`’  
<span id="index-size"></span> <span id="index-LINES"></span> <span
id="index-COLUMNS-1"></span>

Print the number of rows and columns that the kernel thinks the terminal
has. (Systems that don’t support rows and columns in the kernel
typically use the environment variables `LINES` and `COLUMNS` instead;
however, GNU `stty` does not know anything about them.) Non-POSIX.

‘`line n`’  
<span id="index-line"></span>

Use line discipline `n`. Non-POSIX.

‘`speed`’  
<span id="index-speed"></span>

Print the terminal speed.

‘`n`’  
<span id="index-baud-rate_002c-setting"></span>

Set the input and output speeds to `n`. `n` can be one of: 0 50 75 110
134 134.5 150 200 300 600 1200 1800 2400 4800 9600 19200 38400 `exta`
`extb`. `exta` is the same as 19200; `extb` is the same as 38400. Many
systems, including GNU/Linux, support higher speeds. The `stty` command
includes support for speeds of 57600, 115200, 230400, 460800, 500000,
576000, 921600, 1000000, 1152000, 1500000, 2000000, 2500000, 3000000,
3500000, or 4000000 where the system supports these. 0 hangs up the line
if `-clocal` is set.

<span id="index-printenv"></span> <span
id="index-printing-all-or-some-environment-variables"></span> <span
id="index-environment-variables_002c-printing"></span>

`printenv` prints environment variable values. Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
printenv [option] [variable]…
```

</div>

If no `variable`s are specified, `printenv` prints the value of every
environment variable. Otherwise, it prints the value of each `variable`
that is set, and nothing for those that are not set.

The program accepts the following option. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`-0`’  
‘`--null`’

</div>

<span id="id_003a-Print-user-identity"></span>

### 20.1 `id`: Print user identity

<span id="index-id"></span> <span
id="index-real-user-and-group-IDs_002c-printing"></span> <span
id="index-effective-user-and-group-IDs_002c-printing"></span> <span
id="index-printing-real-and-effective-user-and-group-IDs"></span>

`id` prints information about the given user, or the process running it
if no user is specified. Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
id [option]… [user]…
```

</div>

`user` can be either a user ID or a name, with name look-up taking
precedence unless the ID is specified with a leading ‘`+`’. See
[Disambiguating names and IDs](#Disambiguating-names-and-IDs).

<span id="index-POSIXLY_005fCORRECT-8"></span>

By default, it prints the real user ID, real group ID, effective user ID
if different from the real user ID, effective group ID if different from
the real group ID, and supplemental group IDs. In addition, if SELinux
is enabled and the `POSIXLY_CORRECT` environment variable is not set,
then print ‘`context=c`’, where `c` is the security context.

Each of these numeric values is preceded by an identifying string and
followed by the corresponding user or group name in parentheses.

The options cause `id` to print only part of the above information. Also
see [Common options](#Common-options).

‘`-g`’  
‘`--group`’  
<span id="index-_002dg-7"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dgroup-2"></span>

Print only the group ID.

‘`-G`’  
‘`--groups`’  
<span id="index-_002dG-2"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dgroups"></span>

Print only the group ID and the supplementary groups.

‘`-n`’  
‘`--name`’  
<span id="index-_002dn-17"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dname"></span>

Print the user or group name instead of the ID number. Requires `-u`,
`-g`, or `-G`.

‘`-r`’  
‘`--real`’  
<span id="index-_002dr-13"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dreal"></span>

Print the real, instead of effective, user or group ID. Requires `-u`,
`-g`, or `-G`.

‘`-u`’  
‘`--user`’  
<span id="index-_002du-11"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002duser"></span>

Print only the user ID.

‘`-Z`’  
‘`--context`’  
<span id="index-_002dZ-7"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dcontext-7"></span> <span
id="index-SELinux-2"></span> <span id="index-security-context-8"></span>

Print only the security context of the process, which is generally the
user’s security context inherited from the parent process. If neither
SELinux or SMACK is enabled then print a warning and set the exit status
to 1.

‘`-z`’  
‘`--zero`’  
<span id="index-_002dz-17"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dzero-7"></span>

Delimit output items with ASCII NUL characters. This option is not
permitted when using the default format. When multiple users are
specified, and the `--groups` option is also in effect, groups are
delimited with a single NUL character, while users are delimited with
two NUL characters.

Example:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ id -Gn --zero
users <NUL> devs <NUL>
```

</div>

Primary and supplementary groups for a process are normally inherited
from its parent and are usually unchanged since login. This means that
if you change the group database after logging in, `id` will not reflect
your changes within your existing login session. Running `id` with a
user argument causes the user and group database to be consulted afresh,
and so will give a different result.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

<span id="logname_003a-Print-current-login-name"></span>

### 20.2 `logname`: Print current login name

<span id="index-logname"></span> <span
id="index-printing-user_0027s-login-name"></span> <span
id="index-login-name_002c-printing"></span> <span
id="index-user-name_002c-printing"></span> <span id="index-utmp"></span>

`logname` prints the calling user’s name, as found in a
system-maintained file (often `/var/run/utmp` or `/etc/utmp`), and exits
with a status of 0. If there is no entry for the calling process,
`logname` prints an error message and exits with a status of 1.

The only options are `--help` and `--version`. See [Common
options](#Common-options).

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

<span id="index-whoami"></span> <span
id="index-effective-user-name_002c-printing"></span> <span
id="index-printing-the-effective-user-ID"></span>

`whoami` prints the user name associated with the current effective user
ID. It is equivalent to the command ‘`id -un`’.

The only options are `--help` and `--version`. See [Common
options](#Common-options).

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

<span id="index-groups"></span> <span
id="index-printing-groups-a-user-is-in"></span> <span
id="index-supplementary-groups_002c-printing"></span>

`groups` prints the names of the primary and any supplementary groups
for each given `username`, or the current process if no names are given.
If more than one name is given, the name of each user is printed before
the list of that user’s groups and the user name is separated from the
group list by a colon. Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
groups [username]…
```

</div>

The group lists are equivalent to the output of the command ‘`id -Gn`’.

The only options are `--help` and `--version`. See [Common
options](#Common-options).

Primary and supplementary groups for a process are normally inherited
from its parent and are usually unchanged since login. This means that
if you change the group database after logging in, `groups` will not
reflect your changes within your existing login session. Running
`groups` with a list of users causes the user and group database to be
consulted afresh, and so will give a different result.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

### 20.5 `users`: Print login names of users currently logged in

<span id="index-users"></span> <span
id="index-printing-current-usernames"></span> <span
id="index-usernames_002c-printing-current"></span> <span
id="index-login-sessions_002c-printing-users-with"></span>

`users` prints on a single line a blank-separated list of user names of
users currently logged in to the current host. Each user name
corresponds to a login session, so if a user has more than one login
session, that user’s name will appear the same number of times in the
output. Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
users [file]
```

</div>

<span id="index-utmp-1"></span> <span id="index-wtmp"></span>

With no `file` argument, `users` extracts its information from a
system-maintained file (often `/var/run/utmp` or `/etc/utmp`). If a file
argument is given, `users` uses that file instead. A common choice is
`/var/log/wtmp`.

The only options are `--help` and `--version`. See [Common
options](#Common-options).

The `users` command is installed only on platforms with the POSIX
`<utmpx.h>` include file or equivalent, so portable scripts should not
rely on its existence on non-POSIX platforms.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

<span id="index-who"></span> <span
id="index-printing-current-user-information"></span> <span
id="index-information_002c-about-current-users"></span>

`who` prints information about users who are currently logged on.
Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
who [option] [file] [am i]
```

</div>

<span id="index-terminal-lines_002c-currently-used"></span> <span
id="index-login-time"></span> <span id="index-remote-hostname"></span>

If given no non-option arguments, `who` prints the following information
for each user currently logged on: login name, terminal line, login
time, and remote hostname or X display.

<span id="index-utmp-2"></span> <span id="index-wtmp-1"></span>

If given one non-option argument, `who` uses that instead of a default
system-maintained file (often `/var/run/utmp` or `/etc/utmp`) as the
name of the file containing the record of users logged on.
`/var/log/wtmp` is commonly given as an argument to `who` to look at who
has previously logged on.

<span id="index-am-i"></span> <span id="index-who-am-i"></span>

If given two non-option arguments, `who` prints only the entry for the
user running it (determined from its standard input), preceded by the
hostname. Traditionally, the two arguments given are ‘`am i`’, as in
‘`who am i`’.

<span id="index-TZ-4"></span>

Timestamps are listed according to the time zone rules specified by the
`TZ` environment variable, or by the system default rules if `TZ` is not
set. See [Specifying the Time Zone with
`TZ`](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_mono/libc.html#TZ-Variable)
in The GNU C Library Reference Manual.

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`-a`’  
‘`--all`’  
<span id="index-_002da-15"></span> <span

‘`--lookup`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dlookup"></span>

Attempt to canonicalize hostnames found in utmp through a DNS lookup.
This is not the default because it can cause significant delays on

The `who` command is installed only on platforms with the POSIX
`<utmpx.h>` include file or equivalent, so portable scripts should not
rely on its existence on non-POSIX platforms.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

### 21.1 `date`: Print or set system date and time

<span id="index-date"></span> <span
id="index-time_002c-printing-or-setting"></span> <span
id="index-printing-the-current-time"></span>

Synopses:

<div class="example">

``` example
date [option]… [+format]
date [-u|--utc|--universal] [ MMDDhhmm[[CC]YY][.ss] ]
```

</div>

The `date` command displays the date and time. With the `--set` (`-s`)
option, or with ‘`MMDDhhmm[[CC]YY][.ss]`’, it sets the date and time.

<span id="index-LC_005fTIME-6"></span>

Invoking `date` with no `format` argument is equivalent to invoking it
with a default format that depends on the `LC_TIME` locale category. In
the default C locale, this format is ‘`'+%a %b %e %H:%M:%S %Z %Y'`’, so
the output looks like ‘`Thu Jul  9 17:00:00 EDT 2020`’.

<span id="index-TZ-5"></span>

Normally, `date` uses the time zone rules indicated by the `TZ`
environment variable, or the system default rules if `TZ` is not set.
See [Specifying the Time Zone with
`TZ`](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_mono/libc.html#TZ-Variable)
in The GNU C Library Reference Manual.

<span id="index-strftime-and-date"></span> <span
id="index-time-formats-1"></span> <span
id="index-formatting-times-1"></span>

If given an argument that starts with a ‘`+`’, `date` prints the current
date and time (or the date and time specified by the `--date` option,
see below) in the format defined by that argument, which is similar to
that of the `strftime` function. Except for conversion specifiers, which
start with ‘`%`’, characters in the format string are printed unchanged.
The conversion specifiers are described below.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

#### 21.1.1 Time conversion specifiers

<span id="index-time-conversion-specifiers"></span> <span
id="index-conversion-specifiers_002c-time"></span>

`date` conversion specifiers related to times.

‘`%H`’  
hour (‘`00`’…‘`23`’)

‘`%I`’  
hour (‘`01`’…‘`12`’)

‘`%k`’  
hour, space padded (‘` 0`’…‘`23`’); equivalent to ‘`%_H`’. This is a GNU
extension.

‘`%l`’  
hour, space padded (‘` 1`’…‘`12`’); equivalent to ‘`%_I`’. This is a GNU
extension.

‘`%M`’  
minute (‘`00`’…‘`59`’)

‘`%N`’  
nanoseconds (‘`000000000`’…‘`999999999`’). This is a GNU extension.

‘`%p`’  
locale’s equivalent of either ‘`AM`’ or ‘`PM`’; blank in many locales.
Noon is treated as ‘`PM`’ and midnight as ‘`AM`’.

‘`%P`’  
like ‘`%p`’, except lower case. This is a GNU extension.

‘`%r`’  
locale’s 12-hour clock time (e.g., ‘`11:11:04 PM`’)

‘`%R`’  
24-hour hour and minute. Same as ‘`%H:%M`’.

‘`%s`’  
<span id="index-Epoch_002c-seconds-since"></span> <span
id="index-seconds-since-the-Epoch"></span> <span
id="index-beginning-of-time"></span> <span
id="index-leap-seconds-1"></span>

seconds since the Epoch, i.e., since 1970-01-01 00:00 UTC. Leap seconds
are not counted unless leap second support is available. See
[%s-examples](#g_t_0025s_002dexamples), for examples. This is a GNU
extension.

‘`%S`’  
<span id="index-leap-seconds-2"></span>

second (‘`00`’…‘`60`’). This may be ‘`60`’ if leap seconds are
supported.

‘`%T`’  
24-hour hour, minute, and second. Same as ‘`%H:%M:%S`’.

‘`%X`’  
locale’s time representation (e.g., ‘`23:13:48`’)

‘`%z`’  
Four-digit numeric time zone, e.g., ‘`-0600`’ or ‘`+0530`’, or ‘`-0000`’
if no time zone is determinable. This value reflects the numeric time
zone appropriate for the current time, using the time zone rules
specified by the `TZ` environment variable. A time zone is not
determinable if its numeric offset is zero and its abbreviation begins
with ‘`-`’. The time (and optionally, the time zone rules) can be
overridden by the `--date` option.

‘`%:z`’  
Numeric time zone with ‘`:`’, e.g., ‘`-06:00`’ or ‘`+05:30`’), or
‘`-00:00`’ if no time zone is determinable. This is a GNU extension.

‘`%::z`’  
Numeric time zone to the nearest second with ‘`:`’ (e.g., ‘`-06:00:00`’
or ‘`+05:30:00`’), or ‘`-00:00:00`’ if no time zone is determinable.
This is a GNU extension.

‘`%:::z`’  
Numeric time zone with ‘`:`’ using the minimum necessary precision
(e.g., ‘`-06`’, ‘`+05:30`’, or ‘`-04:56:02`’), or ‘`-00`’ if no time
zone is determinable. This is a GNU extension.

‘`%Z`’  
alphabetic time zone abbreviation (e.g., ‘`EDT`’), or nothing if no time
zone is determinable. See ‘`%z`’ for how it is determined.

#### 21.1.2 Date conversion specifiers

<span id="index-date-conversion-specifiers"></span> <span
id="index-conversion-specifiers_002c-date"></span>

`date` conversion specifiers related to dates.

‘`%a`’  
locale’s abbreviated weekday name (e.g., ‘`Sun`’)

‘`%A`’  
locale’s full weekday name, variable length (e.g., ‘`Sunday`’)

‘`%b`’  
locale’s abbreviated month name (e.g., ‘`Jan`’)

‘`%B`’  
locale’s full month name, variable length (e.g., ‘`January`’)

‘`%c`’  
locale’s date and time (e.g., ‘`Thu Mar  3 23:05:25 2020`’)

‘`%C`’  
century. This is like ‘`%Y`’, except the last two digits are omitted.
For example, it is ‘`20`’ if ‘`%Y`’ is ‘`2019`’, and is ‘`-0`’ if ‘`%Y`’
is ‘`-001`’. It is normally at least two characters, but it may be more.

‘`%d`’  
day of month (e.g., ‘`01`’)

‘`%D`’  
date; same as ‘`%m/%d/%y`’

‘`%e`’  
day of month, space padded; same as ‘`%_d`’

‘`%F`’  
full date in ISO 8601 format; like ‘`%+4Y-%m-%d`’ except that any flags
or field width override the ‘`+`’ and (after subtracting 6) the ‘`4`’.
This is a good choice for a date format, as it is standard and is easy
to sort in the usual case where years are in the range 0000…9999.

‘`%g`’  
year corresponding to the ISO week number, but without the century
(range ‘`00`’ through ‘`99`’). This has the same format and value as
‘`%y`’, except that if the ISO week number (see ‘`%V`’) belongs to the
previous or next year, that year is used instead.

‘`%G`’  
year corresponding to the ISO week number. This has the same format and
value as ‘`%Y`’, except that if the ISO week number (see ‘`%V`’) belongs
to the previous or next year, that year is used instead. It is normally
useful only if ‘`%V`’ is also used; for example, the format ‘`%G-%m-%d`’
is probably a mistake, since it combines the ISO week number year with
the conventional month and day.

‘`%h`’  
same as ‘`%b`’

‘`%j`’  
day of year (‘`001`’…‘`366`’)

‘`%m`’  
month (‘`01`’…‘`12`’)

‘`%q`’  
quarter of year (‘`1`’…‘`4`’)

‘`%u`’  
day of week (‘`1`’…‘`7`’) with ‘`1`’ corresponding to Monday

‘`%U`’  
week number of year, with Sunday as the first day of the week
(‘`00`’…‘`53`’). Days in a new year preceding the first Sunday are in
week zero.

‘`%V`’  
ISO week number, that is, the week number of year, with Monday as the
first day of the week (‘`01`’…‘`53`’). If the week containing January 1
has four or more days in the new year, then it is considered week 1;
otherwise, it is week 53 of the previous year, and the next week is
week 1. (See the ISO 8601 standard.)

‘`%w`’  
day of week (‘`0`’…‘`6`’) with 0 corresponding to Sunday

‘`%W`’  
week number of year, with Monday as first day of week (‘`00`’…‘`53`’).
Days in a new year preceding the first Monday are in week zero.

‘`%x`’  
locale’s date representation (e.g., ‘`12/31/99`’)

‘`%y`’  
last two digits of year (‘`00`’…‘`99`’)

‘`%Y`’  
year. This is normally at least four characters, but it may be more.
Year ‘`0000`’ precedes year ‘`0001`’, and year ‘`-001`’ precedes year
‘`0000`’.

#### 21.1.4 Padding and other flags

<span id="index-numeric-field-padding"></span> <span
id="index-padding-of-numeric-fields"></span> <span
id="index-fields_002c-padding-numeric"></span>

Unless otherwise specified, `date` normally pads numeric fields with
zeros, so that, for example, numeric months are always output as two
digits. Most numeric fields are padded on the left. However, nanoseconds
are padded on the right since they are commonly used after decimal
points in formats like ‘`%s.%-N`’. Also, seconds since the Epoch are not
padded since there is no natural width for them.

The following optional flags can appear after the ‘`%`’:

‘`-`’  
(hyphen) Do not pad the field; useful if the output is intended for
human consumption. This is a GNU extension. As a special case, ‘`%-N`’
outputs only enough trailing digits to not lose information, assuming
that the timestamp’s resolution is the same as the current hardware
clock. For example, if the hardware clock resolution is 1 microsecond,
‘`%s.%-N`’ outputs something like ‘`1640890100.395710`’.

‘`_`’  
(underscore) Pad with spaces; useful if you need a fixed number of
characters in the output, but zeros are too distracting. This is a GNU
extension.

‘`0`’  
(zero) Pad with zeros even if the conversion specifier would normally
pad with spaces.

‘`+`’  
Pad with zeros, like ‘`0`’. In addition, precede any year number with
‘`+`’ if it exceeds 9999 or if its field width exceeds 4; similarly,
precede any century number with ‘`+`’ if it exceeds 99 or if its field
width exceeds 2. This supports ISO 8601 formats for dates far in the
future; for example, the command `date --date=12019-02-25 +%+13F`
outputs the string ‘`+012019-02-25`’.

‘`^`’  
Use upper case characters if possible. This is a GNU extension.

‘`#`’  
Use opposite case characters if possible. A field that is normally upper
case becomes lower case, and vice versa. This is a GNU extension.

Here are some examples of padding:

<div class="example">

``` example
date +%d/%m -d "Feb 1"
⇒ 01/02
date +%-d/%-m -d "Feb 1"
⇒ 1/2
date +%_d/%_m -d "Feb 1"
⇒  1/ 2
```

</div>

You can optionally specify the field width (after any flag, if present)
as a decimal number. If the natural size of the output of the field has
less than the specified number of characters, the result is normally
written right adjusted and padded to the given size. For example,
‘`%9B`’ prints the right adjusted month name in a field of width 9.
Nanoseconds are left adjusted, and are truncated or padded to the field
width.

An optional modifier can follow the optional flag and width
specification. The modifiers are:

‘`E`’  
Use the locale’s alternate representation for date and time. This
modifier applies to the ‘`%c`’, ‘`%C`’, ‘`%x`’, ‘`%X`’, ‘`%y`’ and
‘`%Y`’ conversion specifiers. In a Japanese locale, for example, ‘`%Ex`’
might yield a date format based on the Japanese Emperors’ reigns.

‘`O`’  
Use the locale’s alternate numeric symbols for numbers. This modifier
applies only to numeric conversion specifiers.

If the format supports the modifier but no alternate representation is
available, it is ignored.

POSIX specifies the behavior of flags and field widths only for ‘`%C`’,
‘`%F`’, ‘`%G`’, and ‘`%Y`’ (all without modifiers), and requires a flag
to be present if and only if a field width is also present. Other
combinations of flags, field widths and modifiers are GNU extensions.

#### 21.1.5 Setting the time

<span id="index-setting-the-time"></span> <span
id="index-time-setting"></span> <span
id="index-appropriate-privileges-1"></span>

You must have appropriate privileges to set the system clock. For
changes to persist across a reboot, the hardware clock may need to be
updated from the system clock, which might not happen automatically on
your system.

To set the clock, you can use the `--set` (`-s`) option (see [Options
for date](#Options-for-date)). To set the clock without using GNU
extensions, you can give `date` an argument of the form
‘`MMDDhhmm[[CC]YY][.ss]`’ where each two-letter component stands for two
digits with the following meanings:

`MM`  
month

`DD`  
day within month

`hh`  
hour

`mm`  
minute

`CC`  
first two digits of year (optional)

`YY`  
last two digits of year (optional)

`ss`  
second (optional)

Note, the `--date` and `--set` options may not be used with an argument
in the above format. The `--universal` option may be used with such an
argument to indicate that the specified date and time are relative to
Universal Time rather than to the local time zone.

<span id="index-date-options"></span> <span
id="index-options-for-date"></span>

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options). Except for `-u`, these options are all GNU
extensions to POSIX.

‘`-d datestr`’  
‘`--date=datestr`’  
<span id="index-_002dd-19"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002ddate-1"></span> <span

id="index-yesterday"></span> <span id="index-tomorrow"></span> <span
id="index-next-day-1"></span> <span id="index-last-day-1"></span>

Display the date and time specified in `datestr` instead of the current
date and time. `datestr` can be in almost any common format. It can
contain month names, time zones, ‘`am`’ and ‘`pm`’, ‘`yesterday`’, etc.
For example, `--date="2020-07-21 14:19:13.489392193 +0530"` specifies
the instant of time that is 489,392,193 nanoseconds after July 21, 2020
at 2:19:13 PM in a time zone that is 5 hours and 30 minutes east of
UTC.  
Note: input currently must be in locale independent format. E.g., the
LC_TIME=C below is needed to print back the correct date in many
locales:

<div class="example">

``` example
date -d "$(LC_TIME=C date)"
```

</div>

See [Date input formats](#Date-input-formats).

‘`--debug`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002ddebug-1"></span> <span
id="index-debugging-date-strings"></span> <span
id="index-date-strings_002c-debugging"></span> <span
id="index-arbitrary-date-strings_002c-debugging"></span>

Annotate the parsed date, display the effective time zone, and warn
about potential misuse.

‘`-f datefile`’  
‘`--file=datefile`’  
<span id="index-_002df-22"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dfile-1"></span>

Parse each line in `datefile` as with `-d` and display the resulting
date and time. If `datefile` is ‘`-`’, use standard input. This is
useful when you have many dates to process, because the system overhead
of starting up the `date` executable many times can be considerable.

‘`-I[timespec]`’  
‘`--iso-8601[=timespec]`’  
<span id="index-_002dI_005btimespec_005d"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002diso_002d8601_005b_003dtimespec_005d"></span>

Display the date using an ISO 8601 format, ‘`%Y-%m-%d`’.

The argument `timespec` specifies the number of additional terms of the
time to include. It can be one of the following:

‘`auto`’  
Print just the date. This is the default if `timespec` is omitted.

‘`hours`’  
Append the hour of the day to the date.

‘`minutes`’  
Append the hours and minutes.

‘`seconds`’  
Append the hours, minutes and seconds.

‘`ns`’  
Append the hours, minutes, seconds and nanoseconds.

If showing any time terms, then include the time zone using the format
‘`%:z`’. This format is always suitable as input for the `--date` (`-d`)
and `--file` (`-f`) options, regardless of the current locale.

‘`-r file`’  
‘`--reference=file`’  
<span id="index-_002dr-15"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dreference-5"></span>

Display the date and time of the last modification of `file`, instead of
the current date and time.

‘`--resolution`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dresolution"></span>

Display the timestamp resolution instead of the time. Current clock
timestamps that are output by `date` are integer multiples of the
timestamp resolution. With this option, the format defaults to
‘`%s.%N`’. For example, if the clock resolution is 1 millsecond, the
output is:

<div class="example">

``` example
0.001000000
```

</div>

‘`-R`’  
‘`--rfc-email`’  
<span id="index-_002dR-8"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002drfc_002demail"></span>

Display the date and time using the format ‘`%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %z`’,
evaluated in the C locale so abbreviations are always in English. For
example:

<div class="example">

``` example
Mon, 09 Jul 2020 17:00:00 -0400
```

</div>

<span id="index-_002d_002drfc_002d822"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002drfc_002d2822"></span>

This format conforms to Internet RFCs
[5322](https://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc5322),
[2822](https://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc2822) and
[822](https://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc822), the current and previous
standards for Internet email. For compatibility with older versions of
`date`, `--rfc-2822` and `--rfc-822` are aliases for `--rfc-email`.

‘`--rfc-3339=timespec`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002drfc_002d3339_003dtimespec"></span>

Display the date using a format specified by [Internet RFC
3339](https://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc3339). This is like `--iso-8601`,
except that a space rather than a ‘`T`’ separates dates from times, and
a period rather than a comma separates seconds from subseconds. This
format is always suitable as input for the `--date` (`-d`) and `--file`
(`-f`) options, regardless of the current locale.

The argument `timespec` specifies how much of the time to include. It
can be one of the following:

‘`date`’  
Print just the full-date, e.g., ‘`2020-07-21`’. This is equivalent to
the format ‘`%Y-%m-%d`’.

‘`seconds`’  
Print the full-date and full-time separated by a space, e.g.,
‘`2020-07-21 04:30:37+05:30`’. The output ends with a numeric
time-offset; here the ‘`+05:30`’ means that local time is five hours and
thirty minutes east of UTC. This is equivalent to the format
‘`%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S%:z`’.

‘`ns`’  
Like ‘`seconds`’, but also print nanoseconds, e.g.,
‘`2020-07-21 04:30:37.998458565+05:30`’. This is equivalent to the
format ‘`%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%N%:z`’.

‘`-s datestr`’  
‘`--set=datestr`’  
<span id="index-_002ds-27"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dset"></span>

Set the date and time to `datestr`. See `-d` above. See also [Setting
the time](#Setting-the-time).

‘`-u`’  
‘`--utc`’  
‘`--universal`’  
<span id="index-_002du-13"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dutc"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002duniversal"></span> <span
id="index-Coordinated-Universal-Time"></span> <span
id="index-UTC"></span> <span id="index-Greenwich-Mean-Time"></span>
<span id="index-GMT"></span> <span id="index-leap-seconds-3"></span>
<span id="index-TZ-6"></span> <span id="index-Universal-Time"></span>

Use Universal Time by operating as if the `TZ` environment variable were
set to the string ‘`UTC0`’. UTC stands for Coordinated Universal Time,
established in 1960. Universal Time is often called “Greenwich Mean
Time” (GMT) for historical reasons. Typically, systems ignore leap
seconds and thus implement an approximation to UTC rather than true UTC.

#### 21.1.7 Examples of `date`

<span id="index-examples-of-date"></span>

Here are a few examples. Also see the documentation for the `-d` option
in the previous section.

-   To print the date of the day before yesterday:
    <div class="example">

    ``` example
    date --date='2 days ago'
    ```

    </div>

-   To print the date of the day three months and one day hence:
    <div class="example">

    ``` example
    date --date='3 months 1 day'
    ```

    </div>

-   To print the day of year of Christmas in the current year:
    <div class="example">

    ``` example
    date --date='25 Dec' +%j
    ```

    </div>

-   To print the current full month name and the day of the month:

    <div class="example">

    ``` example
    date '+%B %d'
    ```

    </div>

    But this may not be what you want because for the first nine days of
    the month, the ‘`%d`’ expands to a zero-padded two-digit field, for
    example ‘`date -d 1may '+%B %d'`’ will print ‘`May 01`’.

-   To print a date without the leading zero for one-digit days of the
    month, you can use the (GNU extension) ‘`-`’ flag to suppress the
    padding altogether:
    <div class="example">

    ``` example
    date -d 1may '+%B %-d'
    ```

    </div>

-   To print the current date and time in the format required by many
    non-GNU versions of `date` when setting the system clock:
    <div class="example">

    ``` example
    date +%m%d%H%M%Y.%S
    ```

    </div>

-   To set the system clock forward by two minutes:
    <div class="example">

    ``` example
    date --set='+2 minutes'
    ```

    </div>

-   To print the date in Internet RFC 5322 format, use
    ‘`date --rfc-email`’. Here is some example output:
    <div class="example">

    ``` example
    Tue, 09 Jul 2020 19:00:37 -0400
    ```

    </div>

    <span id="g_t_0025s_002dexamples"></span>

-   To convert a date string to the number of seconds since the Epoch
    (which is 1970-01-01 00:00 UTC), use the `--date` option with the
    ‘`%s`’ format. That can be useful in sorting and/or graphing and/or
    comparing data by date. The following command outputs the number of
    the seconds since the Epoch for the time two minutes after the
    Epoch:

    <div class="example">

    ``` example
    date --date='1970-01-01 00:02:00 +0000' +%s
    120
    ```

    </div>

    If you do not specify time zone information in the date string,
    `date` uses your computer’s idea of the time zone when interpreting
    the string. For example, if your computer’s time zone is that of
    Cambridge, Massachusetts, which was then 5 hours (i.e., 18,000
    seconds) behind UTC:

    <div class="example">

    ``` example
    # local time zone used
    date --date='1970-01-01 00:02:00' +%s
    18120
    ```

    </div>

-   If you’re sorting or graphing dated data, your raw date values may
    be represented as seconds since the Epoch. But few people can look
    at the date ‘`1577836800`’ and casually note “Oh, that’s the first
    second of the year 2020 in Greenwich, England.”

    <div class="example">

    ``` example
    date --date='2020-01-01 UTC' +%s
    1577836800
    ```

    </div>

    An alternative is to use the `--utc` (`-u`) option. Then you may
    omit ‘`UTC`’ from the date string. Although this produces the same
    result for ‘`%s`’ and many other format sequences, with a time zone
    offset different from zero, it would give a different result for
    zone-dependent formats like ‘`%z`’.

    <div class="example">

    ``` example
    date -u --date=2020-07-21 +%s
    1595289600
    ```

    </div>

    To convert such an unwieldy number of seconds back to a more
    readable form, use a command like this:

    <div class="example">

    ``` example
    date -d @1595289600 +"%F %T %z"
    2020-07-20 20:00:00 -0400
    ```

    </div>

    Often it is better to output UTC-relative date and time:

    <div class="example">

    ``` example
    date -u -d @1595289600 +"%F %T %z"
    2020-07-21 00:00:00 +0000
    ```

    </div>

-   <span id="index-leap-seconds-4"></span> Typically the seconds count
    omits leap seconds, but some systems are exceptions. Because leap
    seconds are not predictable, the mapping between the seconds count
    and a future timestamp is not reliable on the atypical systems that
    include leap seconds in their counts.

    Here is how the two kinds of systems handle the leap second at the
    end of the year 2016:

    <div class="example">

    ``` example
    # Typical systems ignore leap seconds:
    date --date='2016-12-31 23:59:59 +0000' +%s
    1483228799
    date --date='2016-12-31 23:59:60 +0000' +%s
    date: invalid date '2016-12-31 23:59:60 +0000'
    date --date='2017-01-01 00:00:00 +0000' +%s
    1483228800
    ```

    </div>

    <div class="example">

    ``` example
    # Atypical systems count leap seconds:
    date --date='2016-12-31 23:59:59 +0000' +%s
    1483228825
    date --date='2016-12-31 23:59:60 +0000' +%s
    1483228826
    date --date='2017-01-01 00:00:00 +0000' +%s
    1483228827
    ```

<span id="index-arch"></span> <span
id="index-print-machine-hardware-name"></span> <span
id="index-system-information_002c-printing"></span>

`arch` prints the machine hardware name, and is equivalent to
‘`uname -m`’. Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
arch [option]
```

</div>

The program accepts the [Common options](#Common-options) only.

`arch` is not installed by default, so portable scripts should not rely
on its existence.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

<span id="index-nproc"></span> <span
id="index-Print-the-number-of-processors"></span> <span
id="index-system-information_002c-printing-1"></span>

Print the number of processing units available to the current process,
which may be less than the number of online processors. If this
information is not accessible, then print the number of processors
installed. If the `OMP_NUM_THREADS` or `OMP_THREAD_LIMIT` environment
variables are set, then they will determine the minimum and maximum
returned value respectively. The result is guaranteed to be greater than
zero. Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
nproc [option]
```

</div>

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`--all`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dall-6"></span>

Print the number of installed processors on the system, which may be
greater than the number online or available to the current process. The
`OMP_NUM_THREADS` or `OMP_THREAD_LIMIT` environment variables are not
honored in this case.

‘`--ignore=number`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dignore"></span>

If possible, exclude this `number` of processing units.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

### 21.4 `uname`: Print system information

<span id="index-uname"></span> <span
id="index-print-system-information"></span> <span
id="index-system-information_002c-printing-2"></span>

`uname` prints information about the machine and operating system it is
run on. If no options are given, `uname` acts as if the `-s` option were
given. Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
uname [option]…
```

</div>

If multiple options or `-a` are given, the selected information is
printed in this order:

<div class="example">

``` example
kernel-name nodename kernel-release kernel-version
machine processor hardware-platform operating-system
```

</div>

The information may contain internal spaces, so such output cannot be
parsed reliably. In the following example, `kernel-version` is
‘`#1 SMP Fri Jul 17 17:18:38 UTC 2020`’:

<div class="example">

``` example
uname -a
⇒ Linux dumdum.example.org 5.9.16-200.fc33.x86_64 #1 SMP Mon Dec 21 14:08:22 UTC 2020 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

</div>

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`-a`’  
‘`--all`’  
<span id="index-_002da-16"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dall-7"></span>

Print all of the below information, except omit the processor type and
the hardware platform name if they are unknown.

‘`-i`’  
‘`--hardware-platform`’  
<span id="index-_002di-17"></span> <span

Print the hardware platform name (sometimes called the hardware
implementation). Print ‘`unknown`’ if this information is not available.
Note this is non-portable (even across GNU/Linux distributions).

‘`-m`’  
‘`--machine`’  
<span id="index-_002dm-13"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dmachine"></span> <span

‘`--processor`’  
<span id="index-_002dp-12"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dprocessor"></span> <span

Print the processor type (sometimes called the instruction set
architecture or ISA). Print ‘`unknown`’ if this information is not
available. Note this is non-portable (even across GNU/Linux
distributions).

‘`-o`’  
‘`--operating-system`’  
<span id="index-_002do-9"></span> <span

‘`--kernel-name`’  
<span id="index-_002ds-28"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dkernel_002dname"></span> <span

Print the kernel name. POSIX 1003.1-2001 (see [Standards
conformance](#Standards-conformance)) calls this “the implementation of
the operating system”, because the POSIX specification itself has no
notion of “kernel”. The kernel name might be the same as the operating
system name printed by the `-o` or `--operating-system` option, but it
might differ. Some operating systems (e.g., FreeBSD, HP-UX) have the
same name as their underlying kernels; others (e.g., GNU/Linux, Solaris)
do not.

id="index-printing-the-hostname"></span> <span
id="index-system-name_002c-printing"></span> <span
id="index-appropriate-privileges-2"></span>

With no arguments, `hostname` prints the name of the current host
system. With one argument, it sets the current host name to the
specified string. You must have appropriate privileges to set the host
name. Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
hostname [name]
```

</div>

The only options are `--help` and `--version`. See [Common
options](#Common-options).

`hostname` is not installed by default, and other packages also supply a
`hostname` command, so portable scripts should not rely on its existence
or on the exact behavior documented above.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

### 21.6 `hostid`: Print numeric host identifier

<span id="index-hostid"></span> <span

`hostid` prints the numeric identifier of the current host in
hexadecimal. This command accepts no arguments. The only options are
`--help` and `--version`. See [Common options](#Common-options).

For example, here’s what it prints on one system I use:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ hostid
1bac013d
```

</div>

On that system, the 32-bit quantity happens to be closely related to the
system’s Internet address, but that isn’t always the case.

`hostid` is installed only on systems that have the `gethostid`
function, so portable scripts should not rely on its existence.

### 21.7 `uptime`: Print system uptime and load

<span id="index-uptime"></span> <span
id="index-printing-the-system-uptime-and-load"></span>

`uptime` prints the current time, the system’s uptime, the number of
logged-in users and the current load average.

If an argument is specified, it is used as the file to be read to
discover how many users are logged in. If no argument is specified, a
system default is used (`uptime --help` indicates the default setting).

The only options are `--help` and `--version`. See [Common
options](#Common-options).

For example, here’s what it prints right now on one system I use:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ uptime
 14:07  up   3:35,  3 users,  load average: 1.39, 1.15, 1.04
```

</div>

The precise method of calculation of load average varies somewhat
between systems. Some systems calculate it as the average number of
runnable processes over the last 1, 5 and 15 minutes, but some systems
also include processes in the uninterruptible sleep state (that is,
those processes which are waiting for device I/O). The Linux kernel
includes uninterruptible processes.

`uptime` is installed only on platforms with infrastructure for
obtaining the boot time, and other packages also supply an `uptime`
command, so portable scripts should not rely on its existence or on the
exact behavior documented above.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

### 22.1 `chcon`: Change SELinux context of file

<span id="index-chcon"></span> <span
id="index-changing-security-context"></span> <span
id="index-change-SELinux-context"></span>

`chcon` changes the SELinux security context of the selected files.
Synopses:

<div class="example">

``` example
chcon [option]… context file…
chcon [option]… [-u user] [-r role] [-l range] [-t type] file…
chcon [option]… --reference=rfile file…
```

</div>

Change the SELinux security context of each `file` to `context`. With
`--reference`, change the security context of each `file` to that of
`rfile`.

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`--dereference`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002ddereference-6"></span>

id="index-_002d_002dno_002ddereference-6"></span> <span
id="index-no-dereference"></span>

Affect the symbolic links themselves instead of any referenced file.

‘`--reference=rfile`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dreference-6"></span> <span
id="index-reference-file"></span>

Use `rfile`’s security context rather than specifying a `context` value.

‘`-R`’  
‘`--recursive`’  
<span id="index-_002dR-9"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002drecursive-6"></span>

‘`--preserve-root`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dpreserve_002droot-4"></span>

Refuse to operate recursively on the root directory, `/`, when used
together with the `--recursive` option. See [Treating /
specially](#Treating-_002f-specially).

‘`--no-preserve-root`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dno_002dpreserve_002droot-4"></span>

Do not treat the root directory, `/`, specially when operating
recursively; this is the default. See [Treating /
specially](#Treating-_002f-specially).

‘`-H`’  
<span id="index-_002dH-8"></span> <span
id="index-symbolic-link-to-directory_002c-traverse-if-on-the-command-line-3"></span>

If `--recursive` (`-R`) is specified and a command line argument is a
symbolic link to a directory, traverse it. See [Traversing
symlinks](#Traversing-symlinks).

‘`-L`’  
<span id="index-_002dL-12"></span> <span
id="index-symbolic-link-to-directory_002c-traverse-each-that-is-encountered-3"></span>

In a recursive traversal, traverse every symbolic link to a directory
that is encountered. See [Traversing symlinks](#Traversing-symlinks).

‘`-P`’  
<span id="index-_002dP-10"></span> <span
id="index-symbolic-link-to-directory_002c-never-traverse-3"></span>

Do not traverse any symbolic links. This is the default if none of `-H`,
`-L`, or `-P` is specified. See [Traversing
symlinks](#Traversing-symlinks).

‘`-v`’  
‘`--verbose`’  
<span id="index-_002dv-20"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dverbose-15"></span> <span
id="index-diagnostic"></span>

Output a diagnostic for every file processed.

‘`-u user`’  
‘`--user=user`’  
<span id="index-_002du-14"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002duser-1"></span>

Set user `user` in the target security context.

‘`-r role`’  
‘`--role=role`’  
<span id="index-_002dr-17"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002drole"></span>

Set role `role` in the target security context.

### 22.2 `runcon`: Run a command in specified SELinux context

<span id="index-runcon"></span> <span
id="index-run-with-security-context"></span>

`runcon` runs file in specified SELinux security context.

Synopses:

<div class="example">

``` example
runcon context command [args]
runcon [ -c ] [-u user] [-r role] [-t type] [-l range] command [args]
```

</div>

Run `command` with completely-specified `context`, or with current or
transitioned security context modified by one or more of `level`,
`role`, `type` and `user`.

If none of `-c`, `-t`, `-u`, `-r`, or `-l` is specified, the first
argument is used as the complete context. Any additional arguments after
`command` are interpreted as arguments to the command.

With neither `context` nor `command`, print the current security
context.

<span id="index-restricted-security-context"></span> <span
id="index-NO_005fNEW_005fPRIVS"></span>

Note also the `setpriv` command which can be used to set the
NO_NEW_PRIVS bit using `setpriv --no-new-privs runcon ...`, thus
disallowing usage of a security context with more privileges than the
process would normally have.

`runcon` accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`-c`’  
‘`--compute`’  
<span id="index-_002dc-23"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dcompute"></span>

Compute process transition context before modifying.

‘`-u user`’  
‘`--user=user`’  
<span id="index-_002du-15"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002duser-2"></span>

Set user `user` in the target security context.

‘`-r role`’  
‘`--role=role`’  
<span id="index-_002dr-18"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002drole-1"></span>

Set role `role` in the target security context.

‘`-t type`’  
‘`--type=type`’  
<span id="index-_002dt-22"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dtype-2"></span>

Set type `type` in the target security context.

‘`-l range`’  
‘`--range=range`’  
<span id="index-_002dl-12"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002drange-1"></span>

Set range `range` in the target security context.

<span
id="chroot_003a-Run-a-command-with-a-different-root-directory"></span>

### 23.1 `chroot`: Run a command with a different root directory

<span id="index-chroot"></span> <span
id="index-running-a-program-in-a-specified-root-directory"></span> <span
id="index-root-directory_002c-running-a-program-in-a-specified"></span>

`chroot` runs a command with a specified root directory. On many
systems, only the super-user can do
this.<a href="#FOOT5" id="DOCF5"><sup>5</sup></a>. Synopses:

<div class="example">

``` example
chroot option newroot [command [args]…]
chroot option
```

</div>

Ordinarily, file names are looked up starting at the root of the
directory structure, i.e., `/`. `chroot` changes the root to the
directory `newroot` (which must exist), then changes the working
directory to `/`, and finally runs `command` with optional `args`. If
`command` is not specified, the default is the value of the `SHELL`
environment variable or `/bin/sh` if not set, invoked with the `-i`
option. `command` must not be a special built-in utility (see [Special
built-in utilities](#Special-built_002din-utilities)).

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options). Options must precede operands.

‘`--groups=groups`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dgroups-1"></span>

Use this option to override the supplementary `groups` to be used by the
new process. The items in the list (names or numeric IDs) must be
separated by commas. Use ‘`--groups=''`’ to disable the supplementary
group look-up implicit in the `--userspec` option.

‘`--userspec=user[:group]`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002duserspec"></span>

By default, `command` is run with the same credentials as the invoking
process. Use this option to run it as a different `user` and/or with a
different primary `group`. If a `user` is specified then the
supplementary groups are set according to the system defined list for
that user, unless overridden with the `--groups` option.

‘`--skip-chdir`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dskip_002dchdir"></span>

Use this option to not change the working directory to `/` after
changing the root directory to `newroot`, i.e., inside the chroot. This
option is only permitted when `newroot` is the old `/` directory, and
therefore is mostly useful together with the `--groups` and `--userspec`
options to retain the previous working directory.

The user and group name look-up performed by the `--userspec` and
`--groups` options, is done both outside and inside the chroot, with
successful look-ups inside the chroot taking precedence. If the
specified user or group items are intended to represent a numeric ID,
then a name to ID resolving step is avoided by specifying a leading
‘`+`’. See [Disambiguating names and
IDs](#Disambiguating-names-and-IDs).

Here are a few tips to help avoid common problems in using chroot. To
start with a simple example, make `command` refer to a statically linked
binary. If you were to use a dynamically linked executable, then you’d
have to arrange to have the shared libraries in the right place under
your new root directory.

For example, if you create a statically linked `ls` executable, and put
it in `/tmp/empty`, you can run this command as root:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ chroot /tmp/empty /ls -Rl /
```

</div>

Then you’ll see output like this:

<div class="example">

``` example
/:
total 1023
-rwxr-xr-x 1 0 0 1041745 Aug 16 11:17 ls
```

</div>

If you want to use a dynamically linked executable, say `bash`, then
first run ‘`ldd bash`’ to see what shared objects it needs. Then, in
addition to copying the actual binary, also copy the listed files to the
required positions under your intended new root directory. Finally, if
the executable requires any other files (e.g., data, state, device
files), copy them into place, too.

`chroot` is installed only on systems that have the `chroot` function,
so portable scripts should not rely on its existence.

<span id="index-exit-status-of-chroot"></span>

Exit status:

<div class="display">

``` display
125 if chroot itself fails

<span id="env_003a-Run-a-command-in-a-modified-environment"></span>

### 23.2 `env`: Run a command in a modified environment

<span id="index-env"></span> <span
id="index-environment_002c-running-a-program-in-a-modified"></span>
<span
id="index-modified-environment_002c-running-a-program-in-a"></span>
<span id="index-running-a-program-in-a-modified-environment"></span>

`env` runs a command with a modified environment. Synopses:

<div class="example">

``` example
env [option]… [name=value]… [command [args]…]
env -[v]S'[option]… [name=value]… [command [args]…]'
env
```

</div>

`env` is commonly used on first line of scripts (shebang line):

<div class="example">

``` example
#!/usr/bin/env command
#!/usr/bin/env -[v]S[option]… [name=value]… command [args]…
```

</div>

Operands of the form ‘`variable=value`’ set the environment variable
`variable` to value `value`. `value` may be empty (‘`variable=`’).
Setting a variable to an empty value is different from unsetting it.
These operands are evaluated left-to-right, so if two operands mention
the same variable the earlier is ignored.

Environment variable names can be empty, and can contain any characters
other than ‘`=`’ and ASCII NUL. However, it is wise to limit yourself to
names that consist solely of underscores, digits, and ASCII letters, and
that begin with a non-digit, as applications like the shell do not work
well with other names.

<span id="index-PATH"></span>

The first operand that does not contain the character ‘`=`’ specifies
the program to invoke; it is searched for according to the `PATH`
environment variable. Any remaining arguments are passed as arguments to
that program. The program should not be a special built-in utility (see
[Special built-in utilities](#Special-built_002din-utilities)).

Modifications to `PATH` take effect prior to searching for `command`.
Use caution when reducing `PATH`; behavior is not portable when `PATH`
is undefined or omits key directories such as `/bin`.

In the rare case that a utility contains a ‘`=`’ in the name, the only
way to disambiguate it from a variable assignment is to use an
intermediate command for `command`, and pass the problematic program
name via `args`. For example, if `./prog=` is an executable in the
current `PATH`:

<div class="example">

``` example
env prog= true # runs 'true', with prog= in environment
env ./prog= true # runs 'true', with ./prog= in environment
env -- prog= true # runs 'true', with prog= in environment
env sh -c '\prog= true' # runs 'prog=' with argument 'true'
env sh -c 'exec "$@"' sh prog= true # also runs 'prog='
```

</div>

<span id="index-environment_002c-printing"></span>

If no command name is specified following the environment
specifications, the resulting environment is printed. This is like
specifying the `printenv` program.

For some examples, suppose the environment passed to `env` contains
‘`LOGNAME=rms`’, ‘`EDITOR=emacs`’, and ‘`PATH=.:/gnubin:/hacks`’:

-   Output the current environment.
    <div class="example">

    ``` example
    $ env | LC_ALL=C sort
    EDITOR=emacs
    LOGNAME=rms
    PATH=.:/gnubin:/hacks
    ```

    </div>
-   Run `foo` with a reduced environment, preserving only the original
    `PATH` to avoid problems in locating `foo`.
    <div class="example">

    ``` example
    env - PATH="$PATH" foo
    ```

    </div>
-   Run `foo` with the environment containing ‘`LOGNAME=rms`’,
    ‘`EDITOR=emacs`’, and ‘`PATH=.:/gnubin:/hacks`’, and guarantees that
    `foo` was found in the file system rather than as a shell built-in.
    <div class="example">

    ``` example
    env foo
    ```

    </div>
-   Run `nemacs` with the environment containing ‘`LOGNAME=foo`’,
    ‘`EDITOR=emacs`’, ‘`PATH=.:/gnubin:/hacks`’, and ‘`DISPLAY=gnu:0`’.
    <div class="example">

    ``` example
    env DISPLAY=gnu:0 LOGNAME=foo nemacs
    ```

    </div>
-   Attempt to run the program `/energy/--` (as that is the only
    possible path search result); if the command exists, the environment
    will contain ‘`LOGNAME=rms`’ and ‘`PATH=/energy`’, and the arguments
    will be ‘`e=mc2`’, ‘`bar`’, and ‘`baz`’.
    <div class="example">

    ``` example
    env -u EDITOR PATH=/energy -- e=mc2 bar baz
    ```

    </div>

<span id="General-options-2"></span>

#### 23.2.1 General options

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options). Options must precede operands.

‘`-0`’  
‘`--null`’  
<span id="index-_002d0-2"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dnull-2"></span> <span
id="index-output-NUL_002dbyte_002dterminated-lines-8"></span>

Output a zero byte (ASCII NUL) at the end of each line, rather than a
newline. This option enables other programs to parse the output even
when that output would contain data with embedded newlines.

‘`-u name`’  
‘`--unset=name`’  
<span id="index-_002du-16"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dunset"></span>

Remove variable `name` from the environment, if it was in the
environment.

‘`-`’  
‘`-i`’  
‘`--ignore-environment`’  
<span id="index-_002d-1"></span> <span id="index-_002di-18"></span>
<span id="index-_002d_002dignore_002denvironment"></span>

Start with an empty environment, ignoring the inherited environment.

‘`-C dir`’  
‘`--chdir=dir`’  
<span id="index-_002dC-4"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dchdir"></span>

Change the working directory to `dir` before invoking `command`. This
differs from the shell built-in `cd` in that it starts `command` as a
subprocess rather than altering the shell’s own working directory; this
allows it to be chained with other commands that run commands in a
different context. For example:

<div class="example">

``` example
# Run 'true' with /chroot as its root directory and /srv as its working
# directory.
chroot /chroot env --chdir=/srv true
# Run 'true' with /build as its working directory, FOO=bar in its
# environment, and a time limit of five seconds.
env --chdir=/build FOO=bar timeout 5 true
```

</div>

‘`--default-signal[=sig]`’  
Unblock and reset signal `sig` to its default signal handler. Without
`sig` all known signals are unblocked and reset to their defaults.
Multiple signals can be comma-separated. The following command runs
`seq` with SIGINT and SIGPIPE set to their default (which is to
terminate the program):

<div class="example">

``` example
env --default-signal=PIPE,INT seq 1000 | head -n1
```

</div>

In the following example, we see how this is not possible to do with
traditional shells. Here the first trap command sets SIGPIPE to ignore.
The second trap command ostensibly sets it back to its default, but
POSIX mandates that the shell must not change inherited state of the
signal - so it is a no-op.

<div class="example">

``` example
trap '' PIPE && sh -c 'trap - PIPE ; seq inf | head -n1'
```

</div>

Using `--default-signal=PIPE` we can ensure the signal handling is set
to its default behavior:

<div class="example">

``` example
trap '' PIPE && sh -c 'env --default-signal=PIPE seq inf | head -n1'
```

</div>

‘`--ignore-signal[=sig]`’  
Ignore signal `sig` when running a program. Without `sig` all known
signals are set to ignore. Multiple signals can be comma-separated. The
following command runs `seq` with SIGINT set to be ignored - pressing
<span class="kbd">Ctrl-C</span> will not terminate it:

<div class="example">

``` example
env --ignore-signal=INT seq inf > /dev/null
```

</div>

‘`SIGCHLD`’ is special, in that `--ignore-signal=CHLD` might have no
effect (POSIX says it’s unspecified).

Most operating systems do not allow ignoring ‘`SIGKILL`’, ‘`SIGSTOP`’
(and possibly other signals). Attempting to ignore these signals will
fail.

Multiple (and contradictory) `--default-signal=SIG` and
`--ignore-signal=SIG` options are processed left-to-right, with the
latter taking precedence. In the following example, ‘`SIGPIPE`’ is set
to default while ‘`SIGINT`’ is ignored:

#### 23.2.2 `-S`/`--split-string` usage in scripts

The `-S`/`--split-string` option enables use of multiple arguments on
the first line of scripts (the shebang line, ‘`#!`’).

When a script’s interpreter is in a known location, scripts typically
contain the absolute file name in their first line:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Shell script:</td>
<td><div class="example">
<pre class="example"><code>#!/bin/sh
echo hello</code></pre>
</div></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Perl script:</td>
<td><div class="example">
<pre class="example"><code>#!/usr/bin/perl
print &quot;hello\n&quot;;</code></pre>
</div></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Python script:</td>
<td><div class="example">
<pre class="example"><code>#!/usr/bin/python3
print(&quot;hello&quot;)</code></pre>
</div></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

When a script’s interpreter is in a non-standard location in the `PATH`
environment variable, it is recommended to use `env` on the first line
of the script to find the executable and run it:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Shell script:</td>
<td><div class="example">
<pre class="example"><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash
echo hello</code></pre>
</div></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Perl script:</td>
<td><div class="example">
<pre class="example"><code>#!/usr/bin/env perl
print &quot;hello\n&quot;;</code></pre>
</div></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Python script:</td>
<td><div class="example">
<pre class="example"><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3
print(&quot;hello&quot;)</code></pre>
</div></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Most operating systems (e.g. GNU/Linux, BSDs) treat all text after the
first space as a single argument. When using `env` in a script it is
thus not possible to specify multiple arguments.

In the following example:

<div class="example">

``` example
#!/usr/bin/env perl -T -w
print "hello\n";
```

</div>

The operating system treats ‘`perl -T -w`’ as one argument (the
program’s name), and executing the script fails with:

<div class="example">

``` example
/usr/bin/env: 'perl -T -w': No such file or directory
```

</div>

The `-S` option instructs `env` to split the single string into multiple
arguments. The following example works as expected:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ cat hello.pl
#!/usr/bin/env -S perl -T -w
print "hello\n";

$ chmod a+x hello.pl
$ ./hello.pl
hello
```

</div>

And is equivalent to running `perl -T -w hello.pl` on the command line
prompt.

<span id="Testing-and-troubleshooting"></span>

#### Testing and troubleshooting

<span id="index-single-quotes_002c-and-env-_002dS"></span> <span
id="index-env-_002dS_002c-and-single-quotes"></span> <span
id="index-_002dS_002c-env-and-single-quotes"></span>

To test `env -S` on the command line, use single quotes for the `-S`
string to emulate a single paramter. Single quotes are not needed when
using `env -S` in a shebang line on the first line of a script (the
operating system already treats it as one argument).

The following command is equivalent to the `hello.pl` script above:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ env -S'perl -T -w' hello.pl
```

</div>

<span id="index-env-_002dS_002c-debugging"></span> <span
id="index-debugging_002c-env-_002dS"></span>

To troubleshoot `-S` usage add the `-v` as the first argument (before
`-S`).

Using `-vS` on a shebang line in a script:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ cat hello-debug.pl
#!/usr/bin/env -vS perl -T -w
print "hello\n";

$ chmod a+x hello-debug.pl
$ ./hello-debug.pl
split -S:  'perl -T -w'
 into:    'perl'
     &    '-T'
     &    '-w'
executing: perl
   arg[0]= 'perl'
   arg[1]= '-T'
   arg[2]= '-w'
   arg[3]= './hello-debug.pl'
hello
```

</div>

Using `-vS` on the command line prompt (adding single quotes):

<div class="example">

``` example
$ env -vS'perl -T -w' hello-debug.pl
split -S:  'perl -T -w'
 into:    'perl'
     &    '-T'
     &    '-w'
executing: perl
   arg[0]= 'perl'
   arg[1]= '-T'
   arg[2]= '-w'
   arg[3]= 'hello-debug.pl'
hello
```

#### 23.2.3 `-S`/`--split-string` syntax

<span id="Splitting-arguments-by-whitespace"></span>

#### Splitting arguments by whitespace

Running `env -Sstring` splits the `string` into arguments based on
unquoted spaces or tab characters. (Newlines, carriage returns, vertical
tabs and form feeds are treated like spaces and tabs.)

In the following contrived example the `awk` variable ‘`OFS`’ will be
`<space>xyz<space>` as these spaces are inside double quotes. The other
space characters are used as argument separators:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ cat one.awk
#!/usr/bin/env -S awk -v OFS=" xyz " -f
BEGIN {print 1,2,3}

$ chmod a+x one.awk
$ ./one.awk
1 xyz 2 xyz 3
```

</div>

When using `-S` on the command line prompt, remember to add single
quotes around the entire string:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ env -S'awk -v OFS=" xyz " -f' one.awk
1 xyz 2 xyz 3
```

</div>

<span id="Escape-sequences"></span>

#### Escape sequences

`env` supports several escape sequences. These sequences are processed
when unquoted or inside double quotes (unless otherwise noted). Single
quotes disable escape sequences except ‘`\'`’ and ‘`\\`’.

|      |                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `\c` | Ignore the remaining characters in the string. Cannot be used inside double quotes.                                                                                                                  |
| `\f` | form-feed character (ASCII 0x0C)                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `\n` | new-line character (ASCII 0x0A)                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `\r` | carriage-return character (ASCII 0x0D)                                                                                                                                                               |
| `\t` | tab character (ASCII 0x09)                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `\v` | vertical tab character (ASCII 0x0B)                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `\#` | A hash ‘`#`’ character. Used when a ‘`#`’ character is needed as the first character of an argument (see ’comments’ section below).                                                                  |
| `\$` | A dollar-sign character ‘`$`’. Unescaped ‘`$`’ characters are used to expand environment variables (see ’variables’ section below).                                                                  |
| `\_` | Inside double-quotes, replaced with a single space character. Outside quotes, treated as an argument separator. ‘`\_`’ can be used to avoid space characters in a shebang line (see examples below). |
| `\"` | A double-quote character.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `\'` | A single-quote character. This escape sequence works inside single-quoted strings.                                                                                                                   |
| `\\` | A backslash character. This escape sequence works inside single-quoted strings.                                                                                                                      |

The following `awk` script will use tab character as input and output
field separator (instead of spaces and tabs):

<div class="example">

``` example
$ cat tabs.awk
#!/usr/bin/env -S awk -v FS="\t" -v OFS="\t" -f
...
```

</div>

<span id="Comments"></span>

#### Comments

The escape sequence ‘`\c`’ (used outside single/double quotes) causes
`env` to ignore the rest of the string.

The ‘`#`’ character causes `env` to ignore the rest of the string when
it appears as the first character of an argument. Use ‘`\#`’ to reverse
this behavior.

<div class="example">

``` example
$ env -S'printf %s\n A B C'
A
B
C

$ env -S'printf %s\n A# B C'
A#
B
C

$ env -S'printf %s\n A #B C'
A

$ env -S'printf %s\n A \#B C'
A
#B
C

$ env -S'printf %s\n A\cB C'
A
```

</div>

NOTE: The above examples use single quotes as they are executed on the
command-line.

<span id="Environment-variable-expansion"></span>

#### Environment variable expansion

The pattern ‘`${VARNAME}`’ is used to substitute a value from the
environment variable. The pattern must include the curly braces
(‘`{`’,‘`}`’). Without them `env` will reject the string. Special shell
variables (such as ‘`$@`’, ‘`$*`’, ‘`$$`’) are not supported.

If the environment variable is empty or not set, the pattern will be
replaced by an empty string. The value of ‘`${VARNAME}`’ will be that of
the executed `env`, before any modifications using
`-i`/`--ignore-environment`/`-u`/`--unset` or setting new values using
‘`VAR=VALUE`’.

The following python script prepends `/opt/custom/modules` to the python
module search path environment variable (‘`PYTHONPATH`’):

<div class="example">

``` example
$ cat custom.py
#!/usr/bin/env -S PYTHONPATH=/opt/custom/modules/:${PYTHONPATH} python
print "hello"
...
```

</div>

The expansion of ‘`${PYTHONPATH}`’ is performed by `env`, not by a
shell. If the curly braces are omitted, `env` will fail:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ cat custom.py
#!/usr/bin/env -S PYTHONPATH=/opt/custom/modules/:$PYTHONPATH python
print "hello"
...

$ chmod a+x custom.py
$ custom.py
/usr/bin/env: only ${VARNAME} expansion is supported, error at: $PYTHONPATH python
```

</div>

Environment variable expansion happens before clearing the environment
(with `-i`) or unsetting specific variables (with `-u`):

<div class="example">

``` example
$ env -S'-i OLDUSER=${USER} env'
OLDUSER=gordon
```

</div>

Use `-v` to diagnose the operations step-by-step:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ env -vS'-i OLDUSER=${USER} env'
expanding ${USER} into 'gordon'
split -S:  '-i OLDUSER=${USER} env'
 into:    '-i'
     &    'OLDUSER=gordon'
     &    'env'
cleaning environ
setenv:   OLDUSER=gordon
executing: env
   arg[0]= 'env'
OLDUSER=gordon
```

</div>

### 23.3 `nice`: Run a command with modified niceness

<span id="index-nice"></span> <span id="index-niceness"></span> <span
id="index-scheduling_002c-affecting"></span> <span
id="index-appropriate-privileges-3"></span>

`nice` prints a process’s *niceness*, or runs a command with modified
niceness. *niceness* affects how favorably the process is scheduled in
the system. Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
nice [option]… [command [arg]…]
```

</div>

If no arguments are given, `nice` prints the current niceness.
Otherwise, `nice` runs the given `command` with its niceness adjusted.
By default, its niceness is incremented by 10.

Niceness values range at least from -20 (process has high priority and
gets more resources, thus slowing down other processes) through 19
(process has lower priority and runs slowly itself, but has less impact
on the speed of other running processes). Some systems may have a wider
range of niceness values; conversely, other systems may enforce more
restrictive limits. An attempt to set the niceness outside the supported
range is treated as an attempt to use the minimum or maximum supported
value.

A niceness should not be confused with a scheduling priority, which lets
applications determine the order in which threads are scheduled to run.
Unlike a priority, a niceness is merely advice to the scheduler, which
the scheduler is free to ignore. Also, as a point of terminology, POSIX
defines the behavior of `nice` in terms of a *nice value*, which is the
non-negative difference between a niceness and the minimum niceness.
Though `nice` conforms to POSIX, its documentation and diagnostics use
the term “niceness” for compatibility with historical practice.

`command` must not be a special built-in utility (see [Special built-in
utilities](#Special-built_002din-utilities)).

<span id="index-conflicts-with-shell-built_002dins-6"></span> <span
id="index-built_002din-shell-commands_002c-conflicts-with-6"></span>

Due to shell aliases and built-in `nice` functions, using an unadorned
`nice` interactively or in a script may get you different functionality
than that described here. Invoke it via `env` (i.e., `env nice …`) to
avoid interference from the shell.

Note to change the *niceness* of an existing process, one needs to use
the `renice` command.

The program accepts the following option. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options). Options must precede operands.

‘`-n adjustment`’  
‘`--adjustment=adjustment`’  
<span id="index-_002dn-19"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dadjustment"></span>

Add `adjustment` instead of 10 to the command’s niceness. If
`adjustment` is negative and you lack appropriate privileges, `nice`
issues a warning but otherwise acts as if you specified a zero
adjustment.

For compatibility `nice` also supports an obsolete option syntax
`-adjustment`. New scripts should use `-n adjustment` instead.

`nice` is installed only on systems that have the POSIX `setpriority`
function, so portable scripts should not rely on its existence on
non-POSIX platforms.

<span id="index-exit-status-of-nice"></span>

Exit status:

<div class="display">

``` display
0   if no command is specified and the niceness is output
125 if nice itself fails
126 if command is found but cannot be invoked
127 if command cannot be found
the exit status of command otherwise
```

</div>

It is sometimes useful to run a non-interactive program with reduced
niceness.

<div class="example">

``` example
$ nice factor 4611686018427387903
```

</div>

Since `nice` prints the current niceness, you can invoke it through
itself to demonstrate how it works.

The default behavior is to increase the niceness by ‘`10`’:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ nice
0
$ nice nice
10
$ nice -n 10 nice
10
```

</div>

The `adjustment` is relative to the current niceness. In the next
example, the first `nice` invocation runs the second one with niceness
10, and it in turn runs the final one with a niceness that is 3 more:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ nice nice -n 3 nice
13
```

</div>

Specifying a niceness larger than the supported range is the same as
specifying the maximum supported value:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ nice -n 10000000000 nice
19
```

</div>

Only a privileged user may run a process with lower niceness:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ nice -n -1 nice
nice: cannot set niceness: Permission denied
0
$ sudo nice -n -1 nice
-1
```

</div>

### 23.4 `nohup`: Run a command immune to hangups

<span id="index-nohup"></span> <span
id="index-hangups_002c-immunity-to"></span> <span
id="index-immunity-to-hangups"></span> <span
id="index-logging-out-and-continuing-to-run"></span> <span
id="index-nohup_002eout"></span>

`nohup` runs the given `command` with hangup signals ignored, so that
the command can continue running in the background after you log out.
Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
nohup command [arg]…
```

</div>

If standard input is a terminal, redirect it so that terminal sessions
do not mistakenly consider the terminal to be used by the command. Make
the substitute file descriptor unreadable, so that commands that
mistakenly attempt to read from standard input can report an error. This
redirection is a GNU extension; programs intended to be portable to
non-GNU hosts can use ‘`nohup command [arg]… 0>/dev/null`’ instead.

<span id="index-nohup_002eout-1"></span>

If standard output is a terminal, the command’s standard output is
appended to the file `nohup.out`; if that cannot be written to, it is
appended to the file `$HOME/nohup.out`; and if that cannot be written
to, the command is not run. Any `nohup.out` or `$HOME/nohup.out` file
created by `nohup` is made readable and writable only to the user,
regardless of the current umask settings.

If standard error is a terminal, it is normally redirected to the same
file descriptor as the (possibly-redirected) standard output. However,
if standard output is closed, standard error terminal output is instead
appended to the file `nohup.out` or `$HOME/nohup.out` as above.

To capture the command’s output to a file other than `nohup.out` you can
redirect it. For example, to capture the output of `make`:

<div class="example">

``` example
nohup make > make.log
```

</div>

`nohup` does not automatically put the command it runs in the
background; you must do that explicitly, by ending the command line with
an ‘`&`’. Also, `nohup` does not alter the niceness of `command`; use
`nice` for that, e.g., ‘`nohup nice command`’.

`command` must not be a special built-in utility (see [Special built-in
utilities](#Special-built_002din-utilities)).

The only options are `--help` and `--version`. See [Common
options](#Common-options). Options must precede operands.

<span id="index-exit-status-of-nohup"></span>

Exit status:

<div class="display">

``` display
125 if nohup itself fails, and POSIXLY_CORRECT is not set
126 if command is found but cannot be invoked
127 if command cannot be found
the exit status of command otherwise
```

</div>

If `POSIXLY_CORRECT` is set, internal failures give status 127 instead
of 125.

### 23.5 `stdbuf`: Run a command with modified I/O stream buffering

<span id="index-stdbuf"></span> <span
id="index-standard-streams_002c-buffering"></span> <span
id="index-line-buffered"></span>

`stdbuf` allows one to modify the buffering operations of the three
standard I/O streams associated with a program. Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
stdbuf option… command
```

</div>

`command` must start with the name of a program that

1.  uses the ISO C `FILE` streams for input/output (note the programs
    `dd` and `cat` don’t do that),
2.  does not adjust the buffering of its standard streams (note the
    program `tee` is not in this category).

Any additional `arg`s are passed as additional arguments to the
`command`.

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`-i mode`’  
‘`--input=mode`’  
<span id="index-_002di-19"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dinput"></span>

Adjust the standard input stream buffering.

‘`-o mode`’  
‘`--output=mode`’  
<span id="index-_002do-10"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002doutput-3"></span>

Adjust the standard output stream buffering.

‘`-e mode`’  
‘`--error=mode`’  
<span id="index-_002de-8"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002derror"></span>

Adjust the standard error stream buffering.

The `mode` can be specified as follows:

‘`L`’  
Set the stream to line buffered mode. In this mode data is coalesced
until a newline is output or input is read from any stream attached to a
terminal device. This option is invalid with standard input.

‘`0`’  
Disable buffering of the selected stream. In this mode, data is output
immediately and only the amount of data requested is read from input.
Note the difference in function for input and output. Disabling
buffering for input will not influence the responsiveness or blocking
behavior of the stream input functions. For example `fread` will still
block until `EOF` or error, even if the underlying `read` returns less
data than requested.

‘`size`’  
Specify the size of the buffer to use in fully buffered mode. `size` may
be, or may be an integer optionally followed by, one of the following
multiplicative suffixes:

<div class="example">

``` example
‘KB’ =>           1000 (KiloBytes)
‘K’  =>           1024 (KibiBytes)
‘MB’ =>      1000*1000 (MegaBytes)
‘M’  =>      1024*1024 (MebiBytes)
‘GB’ => 1000*1000*1000 (GigaBytes)
‘G’  => 1024*1024*1024 (GibiBytes)
```

</div>

and so on for ‘`T`’, ‘`P`’, ‘`E`’, ‘`Z`’, and ‘`Y`’. Binary prefixes can
be used, too: ‘`KiB`’=‘`K`’, ‘`MiB`’=‘`M`’, and so on.

`stdbuf` is installed only on platforms that use the Executable and
Linkable Format (ELF) and support the `constructor` attribute, so
portable scripts should not rely on its existence.

<span id="index-exit-status-of-stdbuf"></span>

Exit status:

<div class="display">

``` display
125 if stdbuf itself fails
126 if command is found but cannot be invoked
127 if command cannot be found
the exit status of command otherwise
```

<span id="timeout_003a-Run-a-command-with-a-time-limit"></span>

### 23.6 `timeout`: Run a command with a time limit

<span id="index-timeout"></span> <span id="index-time-limit"></span>
<span id="index-run-commands-with-bounded-time"></span>

`timeout` runs the given `command` and kills it if it is still running
after the specified time interval. Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
timeout [option] duration command [arg]…
```

</div>

`command` must not be a special built-in utility (see [Special built-in
utilities](#Special-built_002din-utilities)).

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options). Options must precede operands.

‘`--preserve-status`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dpreserve_002dstatus"></span>

Return the exit status of the managed `command` on timeout, rather than
a specific exit status indicating a timeout. This is useful if the
managed `command` supports running for an indeterminate amount of time.

‘`--foreground`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dforeground"></span>

Don’t create a separate background program group, so that the managed
`command` can use the foreground TTY normally. This is needed to support
two situations when timing out commands, when not invoking `timeout`
from an interactive shell.

1.  `command` is interactive and needs to read from the terminal for
    example
2.  the user wants to support sending signals directly to `command` from
    the terminal (like Ctrl-C for example)

Note in this mode of operation, any children of `command` will not be
timed out. Also SIGCONT will not be sent to `command`, as it’s generally
not needed with foreground processes, and can cause intermittent signal
delivery issues with programs that are monitors themselves (like GDB for
example).

‘`-k duration`’  
‘`--kill-after=duration`’  
<span id="index-_002dk-7"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dkill_002dafter"></span>

Ensure the monitored `command` is killed by also sending a ‘`KILL`’
signal.

The specified `duration` starts from the point in time when `timeout`
sends the initial signal to `command`, i.e., not from the beginning when
the `command` is started.

This option has no effect if either the main `duration` of the `timeout`
command, or the `duration` specified to this option, is 0.

This option may be useful if the selected signal did not kill the
`command`, either because the signal was blocked or ignored, or if the
`command` takes too long (e.g. for cleanup work) to terminate itself
within a certain amount of time.

‘`-s signal`’  
‘`--signal=signal`’  
<span id="index-_002ds-29"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dsignal"></span>

Send this `signal` to `command` on timeout, rather than the default
‘`TERM`’ signal. `signal` may be a name like ‘`HUP`’ or a number. See
[Signal specifications](#Signal-specifications).

‘`-v`’  
‘`--verbose`’  
<span id="index-_002dv-22"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dverbose-16"></span>

Diagnose to standard error, any signal sent upon timeout.

<span id="index-time-units"></span>

`duration` is a floating point number in either the current or the C
locale (see [Floating point](#Floating-point)) followed by an optional
unit:

<div class="display">

``` display
‘s’ for seconds (the default)
‘m’ for minutes
‘h’ for hours
‘d’ for days
```

</div>

A duration of 0 disables the associated timeout. Note that the actual
timeout duration is dependent on system conditions, which should be
especially considered when specifying sub-second timeouts.

<span id="index-exit-status-of-timeout"></span>

Exit status:

<div class="display">

``` display
124 if command times out, and --preserve-status is not specified
125 if timeout itself fails
126 if command is found but cannot be invoked
127 if command cannot be found
137 if command or timeout is sent the KILL(9) signal (128+9)
the exit status of command otherwise
```

</div>

In the case of the ‘`KILL(9)`’ signal, `timeout` returns with exit
status 137, regardless of whether that signal is sent to `command` or to
`timeout` itself, i.e., these cases cannot be distinguished. In the
latter case, the `command` process may still be alive after `timeout`
has forcefully been terminated.

Examples:

<div class="example">

``` example
# Send the default TERM signal after 20s to a short-living 'sleep 1'.
# As that terminates long before the given duration, 'timeout' returns
# with the same exit status as the command, 0 in this case.
timeout 20 sleep 1

# Send the INT signal after 5s to the 'sleep' command.  Returns after
# 5 seconds with exit status 124 to indicate the sending of the signal.
timeout -s INT 5 sleep 20

# Likewise, but the command ignoring the INT signal due to being started
# via 'env --ignore-signal'.  Thus, 'sleep' terminates regularly after
# the full 20 seconds, still 'timeout' returns with exit status 124.
timeout -s INT 5s env --ignore-signal=INT sleep 20

# Likewise, but sending the KILL signal 3 seconds after the initial
# INT signal.  Hence, 'sleep' is forcefully terminated after about
# 8 seconds (5+3), and 'timeout' returns with an exit status of 137.
timeout -s INT -k 3s 5s env --ignore-signal=INT sleep 20
```

### 24.1 `kill`: Send a signal to processes

<span id="index-kill-1"></span> <span
id="index-send-a-signal-to-processes"></span>

The `kill` command sends a signal to processes, causing them to
terminate or otherwise act upon receiving the signal in some way.
Alternatively, it lists information about signals. Synopses:

<div class="example">

``` example
kill [-s signal | --signal signal | -signal] pid…
kill [-l | --list | -t | --table] [signal]…
```

</div>

<span id="index-conflicts-with-shell-built_002dins-7"></span> <span
id="index-built_002din-shell-commands_002c-conflicts-with-7"></span>

Due to shell aliases and built-in `kill` functions, using an unadorned
`kill` interactively or in a script may get you different functionality
than that described here. Invoke it via `env` (i.e., `env kill …`) to
avoid interference from the shell.

The first form of the `kill` command sends a signal to all `pid`
arguments. The default signal to send if none is specified is ‘`TERM`’.
The special signal number ‘`0`’ does not denote a valid signal, but can
be used to test whether the `pid` arguments specify processes to which a
signal could be sent.

If `pid` is positive, the signal is sent to the process with the process
ID `pid`. If `pid` is zero, the signal is sent to all processes in the
process group of the current process. If `pid` is -1, the signal is sent
to all processes for which the user has permission to send a signal. If
`pid` is less than -1, the signal is sent to all processes in the
process group that equals the absolute value of `pid`.

If `pid` is not positive, a system-dependent set of system processes is
excluded from the list of processes to which the signal is sent.

If a negative `pid` argument is desired as the first one, it should be
preceded by `--`. However, as a common extension to POSIX, `--` is not
required with ‘`kill -signal -pid`’. The following commands are
equivalent:

<div class="example">

``` example
kill -15 -1
kill -TERM -1
kill -s TERM -- -1
kill -- -1
```

</div>

The first form of the `kill` command succeeds if every `pid` argument
specifies at least one process that the signal was sent to.

The second form of the `kill` command lists signal information. Either
the `-l` or `--list` option, or the `-t` or `--table` option must be
specified. Without any `signal` argument, all supported signals are
listed. The output of `-l` or `--list` is a list of the signal names,
one per line; if `signal` is already a name, the signal number is
printed instead. The output of `-t` or `--table` is a table of signal
numbers, names, and descriptions. This form of the `kill` command
succeeds if all `signal` arguments are valid and if there is no output
error.

The `kill` command also supports the `--help` and `--version` options.
See [Common options](#Common-options).

A `signal` may be a signal name like ‘`HUP`’, or a signal number like
‘`1`’, or an exit status of a process terminated by the signal. A signal
name can be given in canonical form or prefixed by ‘`SIG`’. The case of
the letters is ignored, except for the `-signal` option which must use
upper case to avoid ambiguity with lower case option letters. See
[Signal specifications](#Signal-specifications), for a list of supported
signal names and numbers.

### 25.1 `sleep`: Delay for a specified time

<span id="index-sleep"></span> <span

`sleep` pauses for an amount of time specified by the sum of the values
of the command line arguments. Synopsis:

<div class="example">

``` example
sleep number[smhd]…
```

</div>

<span id="index-time-units-1"></span>

Each argument is a non-negative number followed by an optional unit; the
default is seconds. The units are:

‘`s`’  
seconds

‘`m`’  
minutes

‘`h`’  
hours

‘`d`’  
days

Although portable POSIX scripts must give `sleep` a single non-negative
integer argument without a suffix, GNU `sleep` also accepts two or more
arguments, unit suffixes, and floating-point numbers in either the
current or the C locale. See [Floating point](#Floating-point).

For instance, the following could be used to `sleep` for 1 second, 234
milli-, 567 micro- and 890 nanoseconds:

<div class="example">

``` example
sleep 1234e-3 567.89e-6
```

</div>

Also one could sleep indefinitely like:

<div class="example">

``` example
sleep inf
```

</div>

The only options are `--help` and `--version`. See [Common
options](#Common-options).

<span id="factor_003a-Print-prime-factors"></span>

### 26.1 `factor`: Print prime factors

<span id="index-factor"></span> <span id="index-prime-factors"></span>

`factor` prints prime factors. Synopses:

<div class="example">

``` example
factor [number]…
factor option
```

</div>

If no `number` is specified on the command line, `factor` reads numbers
from standard input, delimited by newlines, tabs, or spaces.

The `factor` command supports only a small number of options:

‘`--help`’  
Print a short help on standard output, then exit without further
processing.

‘`--version`’  
Print the program version on standard output, then exit without further
processing.

If the number to be factored is small (less than *2^{127}* on typical
machines), `factor` uses a faster algorithm. For example, on a
circa-2017 Intel Xeon Silver 4116, factoring the product of the eighth
and ninth Mersenne primes (approximately *2^{92}*) takes about 4 ms of
CPU time:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ M8=$(echo 2^31-1 | bc)
$ M9=$(echo 2^61-1 | bc)
$ n=$(echo "$M8 * $M9" | bc)
$ bash -c "time factor $n"
4951760154835678088235319297: 2147483647 2305843009213693951

real    0m0.004s
user    0m0.004s
sys 0m0.000s
```

</div>

For larger numbers, `factor` uses a slower algorithm. On the same
platform, factoring the eighth Fermat number *2^{256} + 1* takes about
14 seconds, and the slower algorithm would have taken about 750 ms to
factor *2^{127} - 3* instead of the 50 ms needed by the faster
algorithm.

Factoring large numbers is, in general, hard. The Pollard-Brent rho
algorithm used by `factor` is particularly effective for numbers with
relatively small factors. If you wish to factor large numbers which do
not have small factors (for example, numbers which are the product of
two large primes), other methods are far better.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

</div>

<span id="numfmt_003a-Reformat-numbers"></span>

### 26.2 `numfmt`: Reformat numbers

<span id="index-numfmt"></span>

`numfmt` reads numbers in various representations and reformats them as
requested. The most common usage is converting numbers to/from *human*
representation (e.g. ‘`4G`’ → ‘`4,000,000,000`’).

<div class="example">

``` example
numfmt [option]… [number]
```

</div>

`numfmt` converts each `number` on the command-line according to the
specified options (see below). If no `number`s are given, it reads
numbers from standard input. `numfmt` can optionally extract numbers
from specific columns, maintaining proper line padding and alignment.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

See `--invalid` for additional information regarding exit status.

<span id="General-options-3"></span>

#### 26.2.1 General options

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options).

‘`--debug`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002ddebug-3"></span>

Print (to standard error) warning messages about possible erroneous
usage.

‘`-d d`’  
‘`--delimiter=d`’  
<span id="index-_002dd-20"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002ddelimiter-1"></span>

Use the character `d` as input field separator (default: whitespace).
*Note*: Using non-default delimiter turns off automatic padding.

‘`--field=fields`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dfield"></span>

Convert the number in input field `fields` (default: 1). `fields`
supports `cut` style field ranges:

<div class="example">

``` example
N    N'th field, counted from 1
N-   from N'th field, to end of line
N-M  from N'th to M'th field (inclusive)
-M   from first to M'th field (inclusive)
-    all fields
```

</div>

‘`--format=format`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dformat-6"></span>

Use printf-style floating FORMAT string. The `format` string must
contain one ‘`%f`’ directive, optionally with ‘`'`’, ‘`-`’, ‘`0`’, width
or precision modifiers. The ‘`'`’ modifier will enable `--grouping`, the
‘`-`’ modifier will enable left-aligned `--padding` and the width
modifier will enable right-aligned `--padding`. The ‘`0`’ width modifier
(without the ‘`-`’ modifier) will generate leading zeros on the number,
up to the specified width. A precision specification like ‘`%.1f`’ will
override the precision determined from the input data or set due to
`--to` option auto scaling.

‘`--from=unit`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dfrom-1"></span>

Auto-scales input numbers according to `unit`. See UNITS below. The
default is no scaling, meaning suffixes (e.g. ‘`M`’, ‘`G`’) will trigger
an error.

‘`--from-unit=n`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dfrom_002dunit"></span>

Specify the input unit size (instead of the default 1). Use this option
when the input numbers represent other units (e.g. if the input number
‘`10`’ represents 10 units of 512 bytes, use ‘`--from-unit=512`’).
Suffixes are handled as with ‘`--from=auto`’.

‘`--grouping`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dgrouping"></span>

Group digits in output numbers according to the current locale’s
grouping rules (e.g *Thousands Separator* character, commonly ‘`.`’
(dot) or ‘`,`’ comma). This option has no effect in ‘`POSIX/C`’ locale.

‘`--header[=n]`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dheader-2"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dheader_003dN"></span>

Print the first `n` (default: 1) lines without any conversion.

‘`--invalid=mode`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dinvalid"></span>

The default action on input errors is to exit immediately with status
code 2. `--invalid=‘abort`’ explicitly specifies this default mode. With
a `mode` of ‘`fail`’, print a warning for *each* conversion error, and
exit with status 2. With a `mode` of ‘`warn`’, exit with status 0, even
in the presence of conversion errors, and with a `mode` of ‘`ignore`’ do
not even print diagnostics.

‘`--padding=n`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dpadding"></span>

Pad the output numbers to `n` characters, by adding spaces. If `n` is a
positive number, numbers will be right-aligned. If `n` is a negative
number, numbers will be left-aligned. By default, numbers are
automatically aligned based on the input line’s width (only with the
default delimiter).

‘`--round=method`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dround"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dround_003dup"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dround_003ddown"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dround_003dfrom_002dzero"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dround_003dtowards_002dzero"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dround_003dnearest"></span>

When converting number representations, round the number according to
`method`, which can be ‘`up`’, ‘`down`’, ‘`from-zero`’ (the default),
‘`towards-zero`’, ‘`nearest`’.

‘`--suffix=suffix`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dsuffix-7"></span>

Add ‘`SUFFIX`’ to the output numbers, and accept optional ‘`SUFFIX`’ in
input numbers.

‘`--to=unit`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dto"></span>

Auto-scales output numbers according to `unit`. See *Units* below. The
default is no scaling, meaning all the digits of the number are printed.

‘`--to-unit=n`’  
<span id="index-_002d_002dto_002dunit"></span>

Specify the output unit size (instead of the default 1). Use this option
when the output numbers represent other units (e.g. to represent
‘`4,000,000`’ bytes in blocks of 1KB, use ‘`--to=si --to-unit=1000`’).
Suffixes are handled as with ‘`--from=auto`’.

‘`-z`’  
‘`--zero-terminated`’  
<span id="index-_002dz-18"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dzero_002dterminated-9"></span> <span
id="index-process-zero_002dterminated-items-9"></span>

Delimit items with a zero byte rather than a newline (ASCII LF). I.e.,
treat input as items separated by ASCII NUL and terminate output items
with ASCII NUL. This option can be useful in conjunction with
‘`perl -0`’ or ‘`find -print0`’ and ‘`xargs -0`’ which do the same in
order to reliably handle arbitrary file names (even those containing
blanks or other special characters). Note with `-z` the newline
character is treated as a field separator.

<span id="Possible-units_003a"></span>

#### 26.2.2 Possible `unit`s:

The following are the possible `unit` options with `--from=UNITS` and
`--to=UNITS`:

`none`  
No scaling is performed. For input numbers, no suffixes are accepted,
and any trailing characters following the number will trigger an error.
For output numbers, all digits of the numbers will be printed.

`si`  
Auto-scale numbers according to the *International System of Units (SI)*
standard. For input numbers, accept one of the following suffixes. For
output numbers, values larger than 1000 will be rounded, and printed
with one of the following suffixes:

<div class="example">

``` example
‘K’  =>  1000^1 = 10^3 (Kilo)
‘M’  =>  1000^2 = 10^6 (Mega)
‘G’  =>  1000^3 = 10^9 (Giga)
‘T’  =>  1000^4 = 10^{12} (Tera)
‘P’  =>  1000^5 = 10^{15} (Peta)
‘E’  =>  1000^6 = 10^{18} (Exa)
‘Z’  =>  1000^7 = 10^{21} (Zetta)
‘Y’  =>  1000^8 = 10^{24} (Yotta)
```

</div>

`iec`  
Auto-scale numbers according to the *International Electrotechnical
Commission (IEC)* standard. For input numbers, accept one of the
following suffixes. For output numbers, values larger than 1024 will be
rounded, and printed with one of the following suffixes:

<div class="example">

``` example
‘K’  =>  1024^1 = 2^{10} (Kibi)
‘M’  =>  1024^2 = 2^{20} (Mebi)
‘G’  =>  1024^3 = 2^{30} (Gibi)
‘T’  =>  1024^4 = 2^{40} (Tebi)
‘P’  =>  1024^5 = 2^{50} (Pebi)
‘E’  =>  1024^6 = 2^{60} (Exbi)
‘Z’  =>  1024^7 = 2^{70} (Zebi)
‘Y’  =>  1024^8 = 2^{80} (Yobi)
```

</div>

The `iec` option uses a single letter suffix (e.g. ‘`G`’), which is not
fully standard, as the *iec* standard recommends a two-letter symbol
(e.g ‘`Gi`’) - but in practice, this method common. Compare with the
`iec-i` option.

`iec-i`  
Auto-scale numbers according to the *International Electrotechnical
Commission (IEC)* standard. For input numbers, accept one of the
following suffixes. For output numbers, values larger than 1024 will be
rounded, and printed with one of the following suffixes:

<div class="example">

``` example
‘Ki’  =>  1024^1 = 2^{10} (Kibi)
‘Mi’  =>  1024^2 = 2^{20} (Mebi)
‘Gi’  =>  1024^3 = 2^{30} (Gibi)
‘Ti’  =>  1024^4 = 2^{40} (Tebi)
‘Pi’  =>  1024^5 = 2^{50} (Pebi)
‘Ei’  =>  1024^6 = 2^{60} (Exbi)
‘Zi’  =>  1024^7 = 2^{70} (Zebi)
‘Yi’  =>  1024^8 = 2^{80} (Yobi)
```

</div>

The `iec-i` option uses a two-letter suffix symbol (e.g. ‘`Gi`’), as the
*iec* standard recommends, but this is not always common in practice.
Compare with the `iec` option.

`auto`  
‘`auto`’ can only be used with `--from`. With this method, numbers with
‘`K`’,‘`M`’,‘`G`’,‘`T`’,‘`P`’,‘`E`’,‘`Z`’,‘`Y`’ suffixes are interpreted
as *SI* values, and numbers with ‘`Ki`’,
‘`Mi`’,‘`Gi`’,‘`Ti`’,‘`Pi`’,‘`Ei`’,‘`Zi`’,‘`Yi`’ suffixes are
interpreted as *IEC* values.

<span id="Examples-of-using-numfmt"></span>

#### 26.2.3 Examples of using `numfmt`

Converting a single number from/to *human* representation:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ numfmt --to=si 500000
500K

$ numfmt --to=iec 500000
489K

$ numfmt --to=iec-i 500000
489Ki

$ numfmt --from=si 1M
1000000

$ numfmt --from=iec 1M
1048576

# with '--from=auto', M=Mega, Mi=Mebi
$ numfmt --from=auto 1M
1000000
$ numfmt --from=auto 1Mi
1048576
```

</div>

Converting from ‘`SI`’ to ‘`IEC`’ scales (e.g. when a drive’s capacity
is advertised as ‘`1TB`’, while checking the drive’s capacity gives
lower values):

<div class="example">

``` example
$ numfmt --from=si --to=iec 1T
932G
```

</div>

Converting a single field from an input file / piped input (these
contrived examples are for demonstration purposes only, as both `ls` and
`df` support the `--human-readable` option to output sizes in
human-readable format):

<div class="example">

``` example
# Third field (file size) will be shown in SI representation
$ ls -log | numfmt --field 3 --header --to=si | head -n4
-rw-r--r--  1     94K Aug 23  2011 ABOUT-NLS

# Second field (size) will be shown in IEC representation
$ df --block-size=1 | numfmt --field 2 --header --to=iec | head -n4
File system   1B-blocks        Used  Available Use% Mounted on
rootfs             132G   104741408   26554036  80% /

/dev/sdb1          694G   651424756   46074696  94% /home
```

</div>

Output can be tweaked using `--padding` or `--format`:

<div class="example">

``` example
# Pad to 10 characters, right-aligned
$ du -s * | numfmt --to=si --padding=10
      2.5K config.log
       108 config.status
      1.7K configure
        20 configure.ac

# Pad to 10 characters, left-aligned
$ du -s * | numfmt --to=si --padding=-10
2.5K       config.log
108        config.status
1.7K       configure
20         configure.ac

# Pad to 10 characters, left-aligned, using 'format'
$ du -s * | numfmt --to=si --format="%10f"
      2.5K config.log
       108 config.status
      1.7K configure
        20 configure.ac

# Pad to 10 characters, left-aligned, using 'format'
$ du -s * | numfmt --to=si --padding="%-10f"
2.5K       config.log
108        config.status
1.7K       configure
20         configure.ac
```

</div>

With locales that support grouping digits, using `--grouping` or
`--format` enables grouping. In ‘`POSIX`’ locale, grouping is silently
ignored:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ LC_ALL=C numfmt --from=iec --grouping 2G
2147483648

$ LC_ALL=en_US.utf8 numfmt --from=iec --grouping 2G
2,147,483,648

$ LC_ALL=ta_IN numfmt --from=iec --grouping 2G
2,14,74,83,648

$ LC_ALL=C numfmt --from=iec --format="==%'15f==" 2G
==     2147483648==

$ LC_ALL=en_US.utf8 numfmt --from=iec --format="==%'15f==" 2G
==  2,147,483,648==

$ LC_ALL=en_US.utf8 numfmt --from=iec --format="==%'-15f==" 2G
==2,147,483,648  ==

$ LC_ALL=ta_IN numfmt --from=iec --format="==%'15f==" 2G
== 2,14,74,83,648==
```

### 26.3 `seq`: Print numeric sequences

<span id="index-seq"></span> <span id="index-numeric-sequences"></span>
<span id="index-sequence-of-numbers"></span>

`seq` prints a sequence of numbers to standard output. Synopses:

<div class="example">

``` example
seq [option]… last
seq [option]… first last
seq [option]… first increment last
```

</div>

`seq` prints the numbers from `first` to `last` by `increment`. By
default, each number is printed on a separate line. When `increment` is
not specified, it defaults to ‘`1`’, even when `first` is larger than
`last`. `first` also defaults to ‘`1`’. So `seq 1` prints ‘`1`’, but
`seq 0` and `seq 10 5` produce no output. The sequence of numbers ends
when the sum of the current number and `increment` would become greater
than `last`, so `seq 1 10 10` only produces ‘`1`’. `increment` must not
be ‘`0`’; use the tool `yes` to get repeated output of a constant
number. `first`, `increment` and `last` must not be `NaN`, but `inf` is
supported. Floating-point numbers may be specified in either the current
or the C locale. See [Floating point](#Floating-point).

The program accepts the following options. Also see [Common
options](#Common-options). Options must precede operands.

‘`-f format`’  
‘`--format=format`’  
<span id="index-_002df-23"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dformat-7"></span> <span
id="index-formatting-of-numbers-in-seq"></span>

Print all numbers using `format`. `format` must contain exactly one of
the ‘`printf`’-style floating point conversion specifications ‘`%a`’,
‘`%e`’, ‘`%f`’, ‘`%g`’, ‘`%A`’, ‘`%E`’, ‘`%F`’, ‘`%G`’. The ‘`%`’ may be
followed by zero or more flags taken from the set ‘`-+#0 '`’, then an
optional width containing one or more digits, then an optional precision
consisting of a ‘`.`’ followed by zero or more digits. `format` may also
contain any number of ‘`%%`’ conversion specifications. All conversion
specifications have the same meaning as with ‘`printf`’.

The default format is derived from `first`, `step`, and `last`. If these
all use a fixed point decimal representation, the default format is
‘`%.pf`’, where `p` is the minimum precision that can represent the
output numbers exactly. Otherwise, the default format is ‘`%g`’.

‘`-s string`’  
‘`--separator=string`’  
<span id="index-_002ds-30"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dseparator-3"></span> <span
id="index-separator-for-numbers-in-seq"></span>

Separate numbers with `string`; default is a newline. The output always
terminates with a newline.

‘`-w`’  
‘`--equal-width`’  
<span id="index-_002dw-13"></span> <span
id="index-_002d_002dequal_002dwidth"></span>

Print all numbers with the same width, by padding with leading zeros.
`first`, `step`, and `last` should all use a fixed point decimal
representation. (To have other kinds of padding, use `--format`).

You can get finer-grained control over output with `-f`:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ seq -f '(%9.2E)' -9e5 1.1e6 1.3e6
(-9.00E+05)
( 2.00E+05)
( 1.30E+06)
```

</div>

If you want hexadecimal integer output, you can use `printf` to perform
the conversion:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ printf '%x\n' $(seq 1048575 1024 1050623)
fffff
1003ff
1007ff
```

</div>

For very long lists of numbers, use xargs to avoid system limitations on
the length of an argument list:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ seq 1000000 | xargs printf '%x\n' | tail -n 3
f423e
f423f
f4240
```

</div>

To generate octal output, use the printf `%o` format instead of `%x`.

On most systems, seq can produce whole-number output for values up to at
least *2^{53}*. Larger integers are approximated. The details differ
depending on your floating-point implementation. See [Floating
point](#Floating-point). A common case is that `seq` works with integers
through *2^{64}*, and larger integers may not be numerically correct:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ seq 50000000000000000000 2 50000000000000000004
50000000000000000000
50000000000000000000
50000000000000000004
```

</div>

However, note that when limited to non-negative whole numbers, an
increment of less than 200, and no format-specifying option, seq can
print arbitrarily large numbers. Therefore `seq inf` can be used to
generate an infinite sequence of numbers.

Be careful when using `seq` with outlandish values: otherwise you may
see surprising results, as `seq` uses floating point internally. For
example, on the x86 platform, where the internal representation uses a
64-bit fraction, the command:

<div class="example">

``` example
seq 1 0.0000000000000000001 1.0000000000000000009
```

</div>

outputs 1.0000000000000000007 twice and skips 1.0000000000000000008.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

## 27 File permissions

Each file has a set of *file mode bits* that control the kinds of access
that users have to that file. They can be represented either in symbolic
form or as an octal number.

<span id="Structure-of-File-Mode-Bits"></span>

### 27.1 Structure of File Mode Bits

The file mode bits have two parts: the *file permission bits*, which
control ordinary access to the file, and *special mode bits*, which
affect only some files.

There are three kinds of permissions that a user can have for a file:

1.  <span id="index-read-permission"></span> permission to read the
    file. For directories, this means permission to list the contents of
    the directory.
2.  <span id="index-write-permission"></span> permission to write to
    (change) the file. For directories, this means permission to create
    and remove files in the directory.
3.  <span id="index-execute_002fsearch-permission"></span> permission to
    execute the file (run it as a program). For directories, this means
    permission to access files in the directory.

There are three categories of users who may have different permissions
to perform any of the above operations on a file:

1.  the file’s owner;
2.  other users who are in the file’s group;
3.  everyone else.

<span id="index-owner_002c-default"></span> <span
id="index-group-owner_002c-default"></span>

Files are given an owner and group when they are created. Usually the
owner is the current user and the group is the group of the directory
the file is in, but this varies with the operating system, the file
system the file is created on, and the way the file is created. You can
change the owner and group of a file by using the `chown` and `chgrp`
commands.

In addition to the three sets of three permissions listed above, the
file mode bits have three special components, which affect only
executable files (programs) and, on most systems, directories:

The *set-user-ID bit* (*setuid bit*).  
<span id="index-set_002duser_002dID"></span> <span
id="index-setuid"></span>

On execution, set the process’s effective user ID to that of the file.
For directories on a few systems, give files created in the directory
the same owner as the directory, no matter who creates them, and set the
set-user-ID bit of newly-created subdirectories.

The *set-group-ID bit* (*setgid bit*).  
<span id="index-set_002dgroup_002dID"></span> <span
id="index-setgid"></span>

On execution, set the process’s effective group ID to that of the file.
For directories on most systems, give files created in the directory the
same group as the directory, no matter what group the user who creates
them is in, and set the set-group-ID bit of newly-created
subdirectories.

The *restricted deletion flag* or *sticky bit*.  
<span id="index-sticky"></span> <span
id="index-swap-space_002c-saving-text-image-in"></span> <span
id="index-text-image_002c-saving-in-swap-space"></span> <span
id="index-restricted-deletion-flag"></span>

Prevent unprivileged users from removing or renaming a file in a
directory unless they own the file or the directory; this is commonly
found on world-writable directories like `/tmp`. For regular files on
some older systems, save the program’s text image on the swap device so
it will load more quickly when run, so that the image is “sticky”.

In addition to the file mode bits listed above, there may be file
attributes specific to the file system, e.g., access control lists
(ACLs), whether a file is compressed, whether a file can be modified
(immutability), and whether a file can be dumped. These are usually set
using programs specific to the file system. For example:

ext2  
On GNU and GNU/Linux the file attributes specific to the ext2 file
system are set using `chattr`.

FFS  
On FreeBSD the file flags specific to the FFS file system are set using
`chflags`.

Even if a file’s mode bits allow an operation on that file, that
operation may still fail, because:

-   the file-system-specific attributes or flags do not permit it; or
-   the file system is mounted as read-only.

For example, if the immutable attribute is set on a file, it cannot be
modified, regardless of the fact that you may have just run
`chmod a+w FILE`.

<span id="Symbolic-Modes-1"></span>

### 27.2 Symbolic Modes

<span id="index-symbolic-modes"></span>

*Symbolic modes* represent changes to files’ mode bits as operations on
single-character symbols. They allow you to modify either all or
selected parts of files’ mode bits, optionally based on their previous
values, and perhaps on the current `umask` as well (see [Umask and
Protection](#Umask-and-Protection)).

The format of symbolic modes is:

<div class="example">

``` example
[ugoa…][-+=]perms…[,…]
```

</div>

#### 27.2.1 Setting Permissions

The basic symbolic operations on a file’s permissions are adding,
removing, and setting the permission that certain users have to read,
write, and execute or search the file. These operations have the
following format:

<div class="example">

``` example
users operation permissions
```

</div>

The spaces between the three parts above are shown for readability only;
symbolic modes cannot contain spaces.

The `users` part tells which users’ access to the file is changed. It
consists of one or more of the following letters (or it can be empty;
see [Umask and Protection](#Umask-and-Protection), for a description of
what happens then). When more than one of these letters is given, the
order that they are in does not matter.

`u`  
<span id="index-owner-of-file_002c-permissions-for"></span>

the user who owns the file;

`g`  
<span id="index-group_002c-permissions-for"></span>

other users who are in the file’s group;

`o`  
<span id="index-other-permissions"></span>

all other users;

`a`  
all users; the same as ‘`ugo`’.

The `operation` part tells how to change the affected users’ access to
the file, and is one of the following symbols:

`+`  
<span id="index-adding-permissions"></span>

to add the `permissions` to whatever permissions the `users` already
have for the file;

`-`  
<span id="index-removing-permissions"></span> <span
id="index-subtracting-permissions"></span>

to remove the `permissions` from whatever permissions the `users`
already have for the file;

`=`  
<span id="index-setting-permissions"></span>

to make the `permissions` the only permissions that the `users` have for
the file.

The `permissions` part tells what kind of access to the file should be
changed; it is normally zero or more of the following letters. As with
the `users` part, the order does not matter when more than one letter is
given. Omitting the `permissions` part is useful only with the ‘`=`’
operation, where it gives the specified `users` no access at all to the
file.

`r`  
<span id="index-read-permission_002c-symbolic"></span>

the permission the `users` have to read the file;

`w`  
<span id="index-write-permission_002c-symbolic"></span>

the permission the `users` have to write to the file;

`x`  
<span id="index-execute_002fsearch-permission_002c-symbolic"></span>

the permission the `users` have to execute the file, or search it if it
is a directory.

For example, to give everyone permission to read and write a regular
file, but not to execute it, use:

<div class="example">

``` example
a=rw
```

</div>

To remove write permission for all users other than the file’s owner,
use:

<div class="example">

``` example
go-w
```

</div>

The above command does not affect the access that the owner of the file
has to it, nor does it affect whether other users can read or execute
the file.

To give everyone except a file’s owner no permission to do anything with
that file, use the mode below. Other users could still remove the file,
if they have write permission on the directory it is in.

<div class="example">

``` example
go=
```

</div>

Another way to specify the same thing is:

<div class="example">

``` example
og-rwx
```

</div>

#### 27.2.2 Copying Existing Permissions

<span id="index-copying-existing-permissions"></span> <span
id="index-permissions_002c-copying-existing"></span>

You can base a file’s permissions on its existing permissions. To do
this, instead of using a series of ‘`r`’, ‘`w`’, or ‘`x`’ letters after
the operator, you use the letter ‘`u`’, ‘`g`’, or ‘`o`’. For example,
the mode

<div class="example">

``` example
o+g
```

</div>

adds the permissions for users who are in a file’s group to the
permissions that other users have for the file. Thus, if the file
started out as mode 664 (‘`rw-rw-r--`’), the above mode would change it
to mode 666 (‘`rw-rw-rw-`’). If the file had started out as mode 741
(‘`rwxr----x`’), the above mode would change it to mode 745
(‘`rwxr--r-x`’). The ‘`-`’ and ‘`=`’ operations work analogously.

#### 27.2.3 Changing Special Mode Bits

<span id="index-changing-special-mode-bits"></span>

In addition to changing a file’s read, write, and execute/search
permissions, you can change its special mode bits. See [Mode
Structure](#Mode-Structure), for a summary of these special mode bits.

To change the file mode bits to set the user ID on execution, use ‘`u`’
in the `users` part of the symbolic mode and ‘`s`’ in the `permissions`
part.

To change the file mode bits to set the group ID on execution, use ‘`g`’
in the `users` part of the symbolic mode and ‘`s`’ in the `permissions`
part.

To set both user and group ID on execution, omit the `users` part of the
symbolic mode (or use ‘`a`’) and use ‘`s`’ in the `permissions` part.

To change the file mode bits to set the restricted deletion flag or
sticky bit, omit the `users` part of the symbolic mode (or use ‘`a`’)
and use ‘`t`’ in the `permissions` part.

For example, to set the set-user-ID mode bit of a program, you can use
the mode:

<div class="example">

``` example
u+s
```

</div>

To remove both set-user-ID and set-group-ID mode bits from it, you can
use the mode:

<div class="example">

``` example
a-s
```

</div>

To set the restricted deletion flag or sticky bit, you can use the mode:

<div class="example">

``` example
+t
```

</div>

The combination ‘`o+s`’ has no effect. On GNU systems the combinations
‘`u+t`’ and ‘`g+t`’ have no effect, and ‘`o+t`’ acts like plain ‘`+t`’.

The ‘`=`’ operator is not very useful with special mode bits. For
example, the mode:

<div class="example">

``` example
o=t
```

</div>

does set the restricted deletion flag or sticky bit, but it also removes
all read, write, and execute/search permissions that users not in the
file’s group might have had for it.

See [Directory Setuid and Setgid](#Directory-Setuid-and-Setgid), for
additional rules concerning set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits and
directories.

#### 27.2.4 Conditional Executability

<span id="index-conditional-executability"></span>

There is one more special type of symbolic permission: if you use ‘`X`’
instead of ‘`x`’, execute/search permission is affected only if the file
is a directory or already had execute permission.

For example, this mode:

<div class="example">

``` example
a+X
```

</div>

gives all users permission to search directories, or to execute files if
anyone could execute them before.

<span id="Making-Multiple-Changes"></span>

#### 27.2.5 Making Multiple Changes

<span id="index-multiple-changes-to-permissions"></span>

The format of symbolic modes is actually more complex than described
above (see [Setting Permissions](#Setting-Permissions)). It provides two
ways to make multiple changes to files’ mode bits.

The first way is to specify multiple `operation` and `permissions` parts
after a `users` part in the symbolic mode.

For example, the mode:

<div class="example">

``` example
og+rX-w
```

</div>

gives users other than the owner of the file read permission and, if it
is a directory or if someone already had execute permission to it, gives
them execute/search permission; and it also denies them write permission
to the file. It does not affect the permission that the owner of the
file has for it. The above mode is equivalent to the two modes:

<div class="example">

``` example
og+rX
og-w
```

</div>

The second way to make multiple changes is to specify more than one
simple symbolic mode, separated by commas. For example, the mode:

<div class="example">

``` example
a+r,go-w
```

</div>

gives everyone permission to read the file and removes write permission
on it for all users except its owner. Another example:

<div class="example">

``` example
u=rwx,g=rx,o=
```

</div>

sets all of the permission bits for the file explicitly. (It gives users
who are not in the file’s group no permission at all for it.)

The two methods can be combined. The mode:

<div class="example">

``` example
a+r,g+x-w
```

</div>

gives all users permission to read the file, and gives users who are in
the file’s group permission to execute/search it as well, but not
permission to write to it. The above mode could be written in several
different ways; another is:

<div class="example">

``` example
u+r,g+rx,o+r,g-w
```

</div>

<span id="The-Umask-and-Protection"></span>

#### 27.2.6 The Umask and Protection

<span id="index-umask-and-modes"></span> <span
id="index-modes-and-umask"></span>

If the `users` part of a symbolic mode is omitted, it defaults to ‘`a`’
(affect all users), except that any permissions that are *set* in the
system variable `umask` are *not affected*. The value of `umask` can be
set using the `umask` command. Its default value varies from system to
system.

<span id="index-giving-away-permissions"></span>

Omitting the `users` part of a symbolic mode is generally not useful
with operations other than ‘`+`’. It is useful with ‘`+`’ because it
allows you to use `umask` as an easily customizable protection against
giving away more permission to files than you intended to.

As an example, if `umask` has the value 2, which removes write
permission for users who are not in the file’s group, then the mode:

<div class="example">

``` example
+w
```

</div>

adds permission to write to the file to its owner and to other users who
are in the file’s group, but *not* to other users. In contrast, the
mode:

<div class="example">

``` example
a+w
```

</div>

ignores `umask`, and *does* give write permission for the file to all
users.

### 27.3 Numeric Modes

<span id="index-numeric-modes"></span> <span
id="index-file-mode-bits_002c-numeric"></span> <span
id="index-octal-numbers-for-file-modes"></span>

As an alternative to giving a symbolic mode, you can give an octal (base
8) number that represents the mode.

The permissions granted to the user, to other users in the file’s group,
and to other users not in the file’s group each require three bits: one
bit for read, one for write, and one for execute/search permission.
These three bits are represented as one octal digit; for example, if all
three are present, the resulting 111 (in binary) is represented as the
digit 7 (in octal). The three special mode bits also require one bit
each, and they are as a group represented as another octal digit. Here
is how the bits are arranged, starting with the highest valued bit:

<div class="example">

``` example
Value in  Corresponding
Mode      Mode Bit

          Special mode bits:
4000      Set user ID
2000      Set group ID
1000      Restricted deletion flag or sticky bit

          The file's owner:
 400      Read
 200      Write
 100      Execute/search

          Other users in the file's group:
  40      Read
  20      Write
  10      Execute/search

          Other users not in the file's group:
   4      Read
   2      Write
   1      Execute/search
```

</div>

For example, numeric mode ‘`4751`’ corresponds to symbolic mode
‘`u=srwx,g=rx,o=x`’, and numeric mode ‘`664`’ corresponds to symbolic
mode ‘`ug=rw,o=r`’. Numeric mode ‘`0`’ corresponds to symbolic mode
‘`a=`’.

A numeric mode is usually shorter than the corresponding symbolic mode,
but it is limited in that normally it cannot take into account the
previous file mode bits; it can only set them absolutely. The
set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits of directories are an exception to
this general limitation. See [Directory Setuid and
Setgid](#Directory-Setuid-and-Setgid). Also, operator numeric modes can
take previous file mode bits into account. See [Operator Numeric
Modes](#Operator-Numeric-Modes).

Numeric modes are always interpreted in octal; you do not have to add a
leading ‘`0`’, as you do in C. Mode ‘`0055`’ is the same as mode ‘`55`’.
However, modes of five digits or more, such as ‘`00055`’, are sometimes
special (see [Directory Setuid and
Setgid](#Directory-Setuid-and-Setgid)).

### 27.4 Operator Numeric Modes

An operator numeric mode is a numeric mode that is prefixed by a ‘`-`’,
‘`+`’, or ‘`=`’ operator, which has the same interpretation as in
symbolic modes. For example, ‘`+440`’ enables read permission for the
file’s owner and group, ‘`-1`’ disables execute permission for other
users, and ‘`=600`’ clears all permissions except for enabling
read-write permissions for the file’s owner. Operator numeric modes can
be combined with symbolic modes by separating them with a comma; for
example, ‘`=0,u+r`’ clears all permissions except for enabling read
permission for the file’s owner.

The commands ‘`chmod =755 dir`’ and ‘`chmod 755 dir`’ differ in that the
former clears the directory `dir`’s setuid and setgid bits, whereas the
latter preserves them. See [Directory Setuid and
Setgid](#Directory-Setuid-and-Setgid).

Operator numeric modes are a GNU extension.

### 27.5 Directories and the Set-User-ID and Set-Group-ID Bits

On most systems, if a directory’s set-group-ID bit is set, newly created
subfiles inherit the same group as the directory, and newly created
subdirectories inherit the set-group-ID bit of the parent directory. On
a few systems, a directory’s set-user-ID bit has a similar effect on the
ownership of new subfiles and the set-user-ID bits of new
subdirectories. These mechanisms let users share files more easily, by
lessening the need to use `chmod` or `chown` to share new files.

These convenience mechanisms rely on the set-user-ID and set-group-ID
bits of directories. If commands like `chmod` and `mkdir` routinely
cleared these bits on directories, the mechanisms would be less
convenient and it would be harder to share files. Therefore, a command
like `chmod` does not affect the set-user-ID or set-group-ID bits of a
directory unless the user specifically mentions them in a symbolic mode,
or uses an operator numeric mode such as ‘`=755`’, or sets them in a
numeric mode, or clears them in a numeric mode that has five or more
octal digits. For example, on systems that support set-group-ID
inheritance:

<div class="example">

``` example
# These commands leave the set-user-ID and
# set-group-ID bits of the subdirectories alone,
# so that they retain their default values.
mkdir A B C
chmod 755 A
chmod 0755 B
chmod u=rwx,go=rx C
mkdir -m 755 D
mkdir -m 0755 E
mkdir -m u=rwx,go=rx F
```

</div>

If you want to try to set these bits, you must mention them explicitly
in the symbolic or numeric modes, e.g.:

<div class="example">

``` example
# These commands try to set the set-user-ID
# and set-group-ID bits of the subdirectories.
mkdir G
chmod 6755 G
chmod +6000 G
chmod u=rwx,go=rx,a+s G
mkdir -m 6755 H
mkdir -m +6000 I
mkdir -m u=rwx,go=rx,a+s J
```

</div>

If you want to try to clear these bits, you must mention them explicitly
in a symbolic mode, or use an operator numeric mode, or specify a
numeric mode with five or more octal digits, e.g.:

<div class="example">

``` example
# These commands try to clear the set-user-ID
# and set-group-ID bits of the directory D.
chmod a-s D
chmod -6000 D
chmod =755 D
chmod 00755 D
```

</div>

This behavior is a GNU extension. Portable scripts should not rely on
requests to set or clear these bits on directories, as POSIX allows
implementations to ignore these requests. The GNU behavior with numeric
modes of four or fewer digits is intended for scripts portable to
systems that preserve these bits; the behavior with numeric modes of
five or more digits is for scripts portable to systems that do not
preserve the bits.

## 28 File timestamps

<span id="index-atime"></span> <span id="index-birthtime"></span> <span
id="index-ctime"></span> <span id="index-mtime"></span>

Standard POSIX files have three timestamps: the access timestamp (atime)
of the last read, the modification timestamp (mtime) of the last write,
and the status change timestamp (ctime) of the last change to the file’s
meta-information. Some file systems support a fourth time: the birth
timestamp (birthtime) of when the file was created; by definition,
birthtime never changes.

One common example of a ctime change is when the permissions of a file
change. Changing the permissions doesn’t access the file, so atime
doesn’t change, nor does it modify the file, so the mtime doesn’t
change. Yet, something about the file itself has changed, and this must
be noted somewhere. This is the job of the ctime field. This is
necessary, so that, for example, a backup program can make a fresh copy
of the file, including the new permissions value. Another operation that
modifies a file’s ctime without affecting the others is renaming.

Naively, a file’s atime, mtime, and ctime are set to the current time
whenever you read, write, or change the attributes of the file
respectively, and searching a directory counts as reading it. A file’s
atime and mtime can also be set directly, via the `touch` command (see
[touch invocation](#touch-invocation)). In practice, though, timestamps
are not updated quite that way.

For efficiency reasons, many systems are lazy about updating atimes:
when a program accesses a file, they may delay updating the file’s
atime, or may not update the file’s atime if the file has been accessed
recently, or may not update the atime at all. Similar laziness, though
typically not quite so extreme, applies to mtimes and ctimes.

Some systems emulate timestamps instead of supporting them directly, and
these emulations may disagree with the naive interpretation. For
example, a system may fake an atime or ctime by using the mtime.

<span id="index-clock-skew-1"></span>

The determination of what time is “current” depends on the platform.
Platforms with network file systems often use different clocks for the
operating system and for file systems; because updates typically uses
file systems’ clocks by default, clock skew can cause the resulting file
timestamps to appear to be in a program’s “future” or “past”.

<span id="index-file-timestamp-resolution"></span>

When the system updates a file timestamp to a desired time `t` (which is
either the current time, or a time specified via the `touch` command),
there are several reasons the file’s timestamp may be set to a value
that differs from `t`. First, `t` may have a higher resolution than
supported. Second, a file system may use different resolutions for
different types of times. Third, file timestamps may use a different
resolution than operating system timestamps. Fourth, the operating
system primitives used to update timestamps may employ yet a different
resolution. For example, in theory a file system might use
10-microsecond resolution for access timestamp and 100-nanosecond
resolution for modification timestamp, and the operating system might
use nanosecond resolution for the current time and microsecond
resolution for the primitive that `touch` uses to set a file’s timestamp
to an arbitrary value.

This section describes the textual date representations that GNU
programs accept. These are the strings you, as a user, can supply as
arguments to the various programs. The C interface (via the
`parse_datetime` function) is not described here.

### 29.1 General date syntax

<span id="index-general-date-syntax"></span> <span
id="index-items-in-date-strings"></span>

A *date* is a string, possibly empty, containing many items separated by
whitespace. The whitespace may be omitted when no ambiguity arises. The
empty string means the beginning of today (i.e., midnight). Order of the
items is immaterial. A date string may contain many flavors of items:

-   calendar date items
-   time of day items
-   time zone items
-   combined date and time of day items
-   day of the week items
-   relative items
-   pure numbers.

We describe each of these item types in turn, below.

<span id="index-numbers_002c-written_002dout"></span> <span
id="index-ordinal-numbers"></span> <span
id="index-first-in-date-strings"></span> <span
id="index-next-in-date-strings"></span> <span
id="index-last-in-date-strings"></span>

A few ordinal numbers may be written out in words in some contexts. This
is most useful for specifying day of the week items or relative items
(see below). Among the most commonly used ordinal numbers, the word
‘`last`’ stands for *-1*, ‘`this`’ stands for 0, and ‘`first`’ and
‘`next`’ both stand for 1. Because the word ‘`second`’ stands for the
unit of time there is no way to write the ordinal number 2, but for
convenience ‘`third`’ stands for 3, ‘`fourth`’ for 4, ‘`fifth`’ for 5,
‘`sixth`’ for 6, ‘`seventh`’ for 7, ‘`eighth`’ for 8, ‘`ninth`’ for 9,
‘`tenth`’ for 10, ‘`eleventh`’ for 11 and ‘`twelfth`’ for 12.

<span id="index-months_002c-written_002dout"></span>

When a month is written this way, it is still considered to be written
numerically, instead of being “spelled in full”; this changes the
allowed strings.

<span id="index-language_002c-in-dates"></span>

In the current implementation, only English is supported for words and
abbreviations like ‘`AM`’, ‘`DST`’, ‘`EST`’, ‘`first`’, ‘`January`’,
‘`Sunday`’, ‘`tomorrow`’, and ‘`year`’.

<span id="index-language_002c-in-dates-1"></span> <span
id="index-time-zone-item"></span>

The output of the `date` command is not always acceptable as a date
string, not only because of the language problem, but also because there
is no standard meaning for time zone items like ‘`IST`’. When using
`date` to generate a date string intended to be parsed later, specify a
date format that is independent of language and that does not use time
zone items other than ‘`UTC`’ and ‘`Z`’. Here are some ways to do this:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ LC_ALL=C TZ=UTC0 date
Tue Jul 21 23:00:37 UTC 2020
$ TZ=UTC0 date +'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%SZ'
2020-07-21 23:00:37Z
$ date --rfc-3339=ns  # --rfc-3339 is a GNU extension.
2020-07-21 19:00:37.692722128-04:00
$ date --rfc-2822  # a GNU extension
Tue, 21 Jul 2020 19:00:37 -0400
$ date +'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z'  # %z is a GNU extension.
2020-07-21 19:00:37 -0400
$ date +'@%s.%N'  # %s and %N are GNU extensions.
@1595372437.692722128
```

</div>

<span id="index-case_002c-ignored-in-dates"></span> <span
id="index-comments_002c-in-dates"></span>

Alphabetic case is completely ignored in dates. Comments may be
introduced between round parentheses, as long as included parentheses
are properly nested. Hyphens not followed by a digit are currently
ignored. Leading zeros on numbers are ignored.

<span id="index-leap-seconds-5"></span>

Invalid dates like ‘`2019-02-29`’ or times like ‘`24:00`’ are rejected.
In the typical case of a host that does not support leap seconds, a time
like ‘`23:59:60`’ is rejected even if it corresponds to a valid leap
second.

### 29.2 Calendar date items

<span id="index-calendar-date-item"></span>

A *calendar date item* specifies a day of the year. It is specified
differently, depending on whether the month is specified numerically or
literally. All these strings specify the same calendar date:

<div class="example">

``` example
2020-07-20     # ISO 8601.
20-7-20        # Assume 19xx for 69 through 99,
               # 20xx for 00 through 68 (not recommended).
7/20/2020      # Common U.S. writing.
20 July 2020
20 Jul 2020    # Three-letter abbreviations always allowed.
Jul 20, 2020
20-jul-2020
20jul2020
```

</div>

The year can also be omitted. In this case, the last specified year is
used, or the current year if none. For example:

<div class="example">

``` example
7/20
jul 20
```

</div>

Here are the rules.

<span id="index-ISO-8601-date-format"></span> <span
id="index-date-format_002c-ISO-8601"></span>

For numeric months, the ISO 8601 format ‘`year-month-day`’ is allowed,
where `year` is any positive number, `month` is a number between 01 and
12, and `day` is a number between 01 and 31. A leading zero must be
present if a number is less than ten. If `year` is 68 or smaller, then
2000 is added to it; otherwise, if `year` is less than 100, then 1900 is
added to it. The construct ‘`month/day/year`’, popular in the United
States, is accepted. Also ‘`month/day`’, omitting the year.

<span id="index-month-names-in-date-strings"></span> <span
id="index-abbreviations-for-months"></span>

Literal months may be spelled out in full: ‘`January`’, ‘`February`’,
‘`March`’, ‘`April`’, ‘`May`’, ‘`June`’, ‘`July`’, ‘`August`’,
‘`September`’, ‘`October`’, ‘`November`’ or ‘`December`’. Literal months
may be abbreviated to their first three letters, possibly followed by an
abbreviating dot. It is also permitted to write ‘`Sept`’ instead of
‘`September`’.

When months are written literally, the calendar date may be given as any
of the following:

<div class="example">

``` example
day month year
day month
month day year
day-month-year
```

</div>

Or, omitting the year:

<div class="example">

``` example
month day
```

</div>

</div>

<span id="Time-of-day-items-1"></span>

### 29.3 Time of day items

<span id="index-time-of-day-item"></span>

A *time of day item* in date strings specifies the time on a given day.
Here are some examples, all of which represent the same time:

<div class="example">

``` example
20:02:00.000000
20:02
8:02pm
20:02-0500      # In EST (U.S. Eastern Standard Time).
```

</div>

<span id="index-leap-seconds-6"></span>

More generally, the time of day may be given as ‘`hour:minute:second`’,
where `hour` is a number between 0 and 23, `minute` is a number between
0 and 59, and `second` is a number between 0 and 59 possibly followed by
‘`.`’ or ‘`,`’ and a fraction containing one or more digits.
Alternatively, ‘`:second`’ can be omitted, in which case it is taken to
be zero. On the rare hosts that support leap seconds, `second` may be
60.

<span id="index-am-in-date-strings"></span> <span
id="index-pm-in-date-strings"></span> <span
id="index-midnight-in-date-strings"></span> <span
id="index-noon-in-date-strings"></span>

If the time is followed by ‘`am`’ or ‘`pm`’ (or ‘`a.m.`’ or ‘`p.m.`’),
`hour` is restricted to run from 1 to 12, and ‘`:minute`’ may be omitted
(taken to be zero). ‘`am`’ indicates the first half of the day, ‘`pm`’
indicates the second half of the day. In this notation, 12 is the
predecessor of 1: midnight is ‘`12am`’ while noon is ‘`12pm`’. (This is
the zero-oriented interpretation of ‘`12am`’ and ‘`12pm`’, as opposed to
the old tradition derived from Latin which uses ‘`12m`’ for noon and
‘`12pm`’ for midnight.)

<span id="index-time-zone-correction"></span> <span
id="index-minutes_002c-time-zone-correction-by"></span>

The time may alternatively be followed by a time zone correction,
expressed as ‘`shhmm`’, where `s` is ‘`+`’ or ‘`-`’, `hh` is a number of
zone hours and `mm` is a number of zone minutes. The zone minutes term,
`mm`, may be omitted, in which case the one- or two-digit correction is
interpreted as a number of hours. You can also separate `hh` from `mm`
with a colon. When a time zone correction is given this way, it forces
interpretation of the time relative to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC),
overriding any previous specification for the time zone or the local
time zone. For example, ‘`+0530`’ and ‘`+05:30`’ both stand for the time
zone 5.5 hours ahead of UTC (e.g., India). This is the best way to
specify a time zone correction by fractional parts of an hour. The
maximum zone correction is 24 hours.

Either ‘`am`’/‘`pm`’ or a time zone correction may be specified, but not
both.

</div>

<span id="Time-zone-items-1"></span>

### 29.4 Time zone items

<span id="index-time-zone-item-1"></span>

A *time zone item* specifies an international time zone, indicated by a
small set of letters, e.g., ‘`UTC`’ or ‘`Z`’ for Coordinated Universal
Time. Any included periods are ignored. By following a
non-daylight-saving time zone by the string ‘`DST`’ in a separate word
(that is, separated by some white space), the corresponding daylight
saving time zone may be specified. Alternatively, a non-daylight-saving
time zone can be followed by a time zone correction, to add the two
values. This is normally done only for ‘`UTC`’; for example,
‘`UTC+05:30`’ is equivalent to ‘`+05:30`’.

Time zone items other than ‘`UTC`’ and ‘`Z`’ are obsolescent and are not
recommended, because they are ambiguous; for example, ‘`EST`’ has a
different meaning in Australia than in the United States, and ‘`A`’ has
different meaning as a military time zone than as an obsolescent RFC 822
time zone. Instead, it’s better to use unambiguous numeric time zone
corrections like ‘`-0500`’, as described in the previous section.

If neither a time zone item nor a time zone correction is supplied,
timestamps are interpreted using the rules of the default time zone (see
[Specifying time zone rules](#Specifying-time-zone-rules)).

<span id="index-combined-date-and-time-of-day-item"></span> <span
id="index-ISO-8601-date-and-time-of-day-format"></span> <span
id="index-date-and-time-of-day-format_002c-ISO-8601"></span>

The ISO 8601 date and time of day extended format consists of an ISO
8601 date, a ‘`T`’ character separator, and an ISO 8601 time of day.
This format is also recognized if the ‘`T`’ is replaced by a space.

In this format, the time of day should use 24-hour notation. Fractional
seconds are allowed, with either comma or period preceding the fraction.
ISO 8601 fractional minutes and hours are not supported. Typically,
hosts support nanosecond timestamp resolution; excess precision is
silently discarded.

Here are some examples:

<div class="example">

``` example
2012-09-24T20:02:00.052-05:00
2012-12-31T23:59:59,999999999+11:00

<span id="Day-of-week-items-1"></span>

### 29.6 Day of week items

<span id="index-day-of-week-item"></span>

The explicit mention of a day of the week will forward the date (only if
necessary) to reach that day of the week in the future.

Days of the week may be spelled out in full: ‘`Sunday`’, ‘`Monday`’,
‘`Tuesday`’, ‘`Wednesday`’, ‘`Thursday`’, ‘`Friday`’ or ‘`Saturday`’.
Days may be abbreviated to their first three letters, optionally
followed by a period. The special abbreviations ‘`Tues`’ for
‘`Tuesday`’, ‘`Wednes`’ for ‘`Wednesday`’ and ‘`Thur`’ or ‘`Thurs`’ for
‘`Thursday`’ are also allowed.

<span id="index-next-day"></span> <span id="index-last-day"></span>

A number may precede a day of the week item to move forward
supplementary weeks. It is best used in expression like
‘`third monday`’. In this context, ‘`last day`’ or ‘`next day`’ is also
acceptable; they move one week before or after the day that `day` by
itself would represent.

A comma following a day of the week item is ignored.

### 29.7 Relative items in date strings

<span id="index-relative-items-in-date-strings"></span> <span
id="index-displacement-of-dates"></span>

*Relative items* adjust a date (or the current date if none) forward or
backward. The effects of relative items accumulate. Here are some
examples:

<div class="example">

``` example
1 year
1 year ago
3 years
2 days
```

</div>

<span id="index-year-in-date-strings"></span> <span
id="index-month-in-date-strings"></span> <span
id="index-fortnight-in-date-strings"></span> <span
id="index-week-in-date-strings"></span> <span
id="index-day-in-date-strings"></span> <span
id="index-hour-in-date-strings"></span> <span
id="index-minute-in-date-strings"></span>

The unit of time displacement may be selected by the string ‘`year`’ or
‘`month`’ for moving by whole years or months. These are fuzzy units, as
years and months are not all of equal duration. More precise units are
‘`fortnight`’ which is worth 14 days, ‘`week`’ worth 7 days, ‘`day`’
worth 24 hours, ‘`hour`’ worth 60 minutes, ‘`minute`’ or ‘`min`’ worth
60 seconds, and ‘`second`’ or ‘`sec`’ worth one second. An ‘`s`’ suffix
on these units is accepted and ignored.

<span id="index-ago-in-date-strings"></span>

The unit of time may be preceded by a multiplier, given as an optionally
signed number. Unsigned numbers are taken as positively signed. No
number at all implies 1 for a multiplier. Following a relative item by
the string ‘`ago`’ is equivalent to preceding the unit by a multiplier
with value *-1*.

<span id="index-day-in-date-strings-1"></span> <span
id="index-tomorrow-in-date-strings"></span> <span
id="index-yesterday-in-date-strings"></span>

The string ‘`tomorrow`’ is worth one day in the future (equivalent to
‘`day`’), the string ‘`yesterday`’ is worth one day in the past
(equivalent to ‘`day ago`’).

<span id="index-now-in-date-strings"></span> <span
id="index-today-in-date-strings"></span> <span
id="index-this-in-date-strings"></span>

The strings ‘`now`’ or ‘`today`’ are relative items corresponding to
zero-valued time displacement, these strings come from the fact a
zero-valued time displacement represents the current time when not
otherwise changed by previous items. They may be used to stress other
items, like in ‘`12:00 today`’. The string ‘`this`’ also has the meaning
of a zero-valued time displacement, but is preferred in date strings
like ‘`this thursday`’.

When a relative item causes the resulting date to cross a boundary where
the clocks were adjusted, typically for daylight saving time, the
resulting date and time are adjusted accordingly.

The fuzz in units can cause problems with relative items. For example,
‘`2020-07-31 -1 month`’ might evaluate to 2020-07-01, because 2020-06-31
is an invalid date. To determine the previous month more reliably, you
can ask for the month before the 15th of the current month. For example:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ date -R
Thu, 31 Jul 2020 13:02:39 -0400
$ date --date='-1 month' +'Last month was %B?'
Last month was July?
$ date --date="$(date +%Y-%m-15) -1 month" +'Last month was %B!'
Last month was June!
```

</div>

Also, take care when manipulating dates around clock changes such as
daylight saving leaps. In a few cases these have added or subtracted as
much as 24 hours from the clock, so it is often wise to adopt universal
time by setting the `TZ` environment variable to ‘`UTC0`’ before
embarking on calendrical calculations.

### 29.8 Pure numbers in date strings

<span id="index-pure-numbers-in-date-strings"></span>

The precise interpretation of a pure decimal number depends on the
context in the date string.

If the decimal number is of the form `yyyy``mm``dd` and no other
calendar date item (see [Calendar date items](#Calendar-date-items))
appears before it in the date string, then `yyyy` is read as the year,
`mm` as the month number and `dd` as the day of the month, for the
specified calendar date.

If the decimal number is of the form `hh``mm` and no other time of day
item appears before it in the date string, then `hh` is read as the hour
of the day and `mm` as the minute of the hour, for the specified time of
day. `mm` can also be omitted.

If both a calendar date and a time of day appear to the left of a number
in the date string, but no relative item, then the number overrides the
year.

<span id="Seconds-since-the-Epoch-1"></span>

### 29.9 Seconds since the Epoch

If you precede a number with ‘`@`’, it represents an internal timestamp
as a count of seconds. The number can contain an internal decimal point
(either ‘`.`’ or ‘`,`’); any excess precision not supported by the
internal representation is truncated toward minus infinity. Such a
number cannot be combined with any other date item, as it specifies a
complete timestamp.

<span id="index-beginning-of-time_002c-for-POSIX"></span> <span
id="index-Epoch_002c-for-POSIX"></span>

Internally, computer times are represented as a count of seconds since
an Epoch—a well-defined point of time. On GNU and POSIX systems, the
Epoch is 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC, so ‘`@0`’ represents this time, ‘`@1`’
represents 1970-01-01 00:00:01 UTC, and so forth. GNU and most other
POSIX-compliant systems support such times as an extension to POSIX,
using negative counts, so that ‘`@-1`’ represents 1969-12-31 23:59:59
UTC.

Most modern systems count seconds with 64-bit two’s-complement integers
of seconds with nanosecond subcounts, which is a range that includes the
known lifetime of the universe with nanosecond resolution. Some
obsolescent systems count seconds with 32-bit two’s-complement integers
and can represent times from 1901-12-13 20:45:52 through 2038-01-19
03:14:07 UTC. A few systems sport other time ranges.

<span id="index-leap-seconds-7"></span>

On most hosts, these counts ignore the presence of leap seconds. For
example, on most hosts ‘`@1483228799`’ represents 2016-12-31 23:59:59
UTC, ‘`@1483228800`’ represents 2017-01-01 00:00:00 UTC, and there is no
way to represent the intervening leap second 2016-12-31 23:59:60 UTC.

### 29.10 Specifying time zone rules

<span id="index-TZ-7"></span>

Normally, dates are interpreted using the rules of the current time
zone, which in turn are specified by the `TZ` environment variable, or
by a system default if `TZ` is not set. To specify a different set of
default time zone rules that apply just to one date, start the date with
a string of the form ‘`TZ="rule"`’. The two quote characters (‘`"`’)
must be present in the date, and any quotes or backslashes within `rule`
must be escaped by a backslash.

For example, with the GNU `date` command you can answer the question
“What time is it in New York when a Paris clock shows 6:30am on October
31, 2019?” by using a date beginning with ‘`TZ="Europe/Paris"`’ as shown
in the following shell transcript:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ export TZ="America/New_York"
$ date --date='TZ="Europe/Paris" 2019-10-31 06:30'
Sun Oct 31 01:30:00 EDT 2019
```

</div>

In this example, the `--date` operand begins with its own `TZ` setting,
so the rest of that operand is processed according to ‘`Europe/Paris`’
rules, treating the string ‘`2019-10-31 06:30`’ as if it were in Paris.
However, since the output of the `date` command is processed according
to the overall time zone rules, it uses New York time. (Paris was
normally six hours ahead of New York in 2019, but this example refers to
a brief Halloween period when the gap was five hours.)

A `TZ` value is a rule that typically names a location in the [‘`tz`’
database](https://www.iana.org/time-zones). A recent catalog of location
names appears in the [TWiki Date and Time
Gateway](https://twiki.org/cgi-bin/xtra/tzdatepick.html). A few non-GNU
hosts require a colon before a location name in a `TZ` setting, e.g.,
‘`TZ=":America/New_York"`’.

The ‘`tz`’ database includes a wide variety of locations ranging from
‘`Arctic/Longyearbyen`’ to ‘`Antarctica/South_Pole`’, but if you are at
sea and have your own private time zone, or if you are using a non-GNU
host that does not support the ‘`tz`’ database, you may need to use a
POSIX rule instead. Simple POSIX rules like ‘`UTC0`’ specify a time zone
without daylight saving time; other rules can specify simple daylight
saving regimes. See [Specifying the Time Zone with
`TZ`](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_mono/libc.html#TZ-Variable)
in The GNU C Library.

`parse_datetime` started life as `getdate`, as originally implemented by
Steven M. Bellovin (<smb@research.att.com>) while at the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The code was later tweaked by a couple of
people on Usenet, then completely overhauled by Rich $alz
(<rsalz@bbn.com>) and Jim Berets (<jberets@bbn.com>) in August, 1990.
Various revisions for the GNU system were made by David MacKenzie, Jim
Meyering, Paul Eggert and others, including renaming it to `get_date` to
avoid a conflict with the alternative Posix function `getdate`, and a
later rename to `parse_datetime`. The Posix function `getdate` can parse
more locale-specific dates using `strptime`, but relies on an
environment variable and external file, and lacks the thread-safety of
`parse_datetime`.

This chapter was originally produced by François Pinard
(<pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>) from the `parse_datetime.y` source code, and
then edited by K. Berry (<kb@cs.umb.edu>).

### 30.1 Version sort overview

*Version sort* puts items such as file names and lines of text in an
order that feels natural to people, when the text contains a mixture of
letters and digits.

Lexicographic sorting usually does not produce the order that one
expects because comparisons are made on a character-by-character basis.

Compare the sorting of the following items:

<div class="example">

``` example
Lexicographic sort:          Version Sort:

a1                           a1
a120                         a2
a13                          a13
a2                           a120
```

</div>

Version sort functionality in GNU Coreutils is available in the
‘`ls -v`’, ‘`ls --sort=version`’, ‘`sort -V`’, and
‘`sort --version-sort`’ commands.

#### 30.1.1 Using version sort in GNU Coreutils

Two GNU Coreutils programs use version sort: `ls` and `sort`.

To list files in version sort order, use `ls` with the `-v` or
`--sort=version` option:

<div class="example">

``` example
default sort:              version sort:

$ ls -1                    $ ls -1 -v
a1                         a1
a100                       a1.4
a1.13                      a1.13
a1.4                       a1.40
a1.40                      a2
a2                         a100
```

</div>

To sort text files in version sort order, use `sort` with the `-V` or
`--version-sort` option:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ cat input
b3
b11
b1
b20


lexicographic order:       version sort order:

$ sort input               $ sort -V input
b1                         b1
b11                        b3
b20                        b11
b3                         b20
```

</div>

To sort a specific field in a file, use `-k/--key` with ‘`V`’ type
sorting, which is often combined with ‘`b`’ to ignore leading blanks in
the field:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ cat input2
100   b3   apples
2000  b11  oranges
3000  b1   potatoes
4000  b20  bananas
$ sort -k 2bV,2 input2
3000  b1   potatoes
100   b3   apples
2000  b11  oranges
4000  b20  bananas
```

#### 30.1.2 Version sort and natural sort

In GNU Coreutils, the name *version sort* was chosen because it is based
on Debian GNU/Linux’s algorithm of sorting packages’ versions.

Its goal is to answer questions like “Which package is newer,
`firefox-60.7.2` or `firefox-60.12.3`?”

In Coreutils this algorithm was slightly modified to work on more
general input such as textual strings and file names (see [Differences
from Debian version sort](#Differences-from-Debian-version-sort)).

In other contexts, such as other programs and other programming
languages, a similar sorting functionality is called [natural
sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_sort_order).

</div>

<span id="Variations-in-version-sort-order-1"></span>

#### 30.1.3 Variations in version sort order

Currently there is no standard for version sort.

That is: there is no one correct way or universally agreed-upon way to
order items. Each program and each programming language can decide its
own ordering algorithm and call it “version sort”, “natural sort”, or
other names.

See [Other version/natural sort
implementations](#Other-version_002fnatural-sort-implementations) for
many examples of differing sorting possibilities, each with its own
rules and variations.

If you find a bug in the Coreutils implementation of version-sort,
please report it. See [Reporting version sort
bugs](#Reporting-version-sort-bugs).

### 30.2 Version sort implementation

GNU Coreutils version sort is based on the “upstream version” part of
[Debian’s versioning
scheme](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#version).

This section describes the GNU Coreutils sort ordering rules.

The next section ([Differences from Debian version
sort](#Differences-from-Debian-version-sort)) describes some differences
between GNU Coreutils and Debian version sort.

#### 30.2.1 Version-sort ordering rules

The version sort ordering rules are:

1.  The strings are compared from left to right.
2.  First the initial part of each string consisting entirely of
    non-digit bytes is determined.
    1.  These two parts (either of which may be empty) are compared
        lexically. If a difference is found it is returned.
    2.  The lexical comparison is a lexicographic comparison of byte
        strings, except that:
        1.  ASCII letters sort before other bytes.
        2.  A tilde sorts before anything, even an empty string.
3.  Then the initial part of the remainder of each string that contains
    all the leading digits is determined. The numerical values
    represented by these two parts are compared, and any difference
    found is returned as the result of the comparison.
    1.  For these purposes an empty string (which can only occur at the
        end of one or both version strings being compared) counts as
        zero.
    2.  Because the numerical value is used, non-identical strings can
        compare equal. For example, ‘`123`’ compares equal to ‘`00123`’,
        and the empty string compares equal to ‘`0`’.
4.  These two steps (comparing and removing initial non-digit strings
    and initial digit strings) are repeated until a difference is found
    or both strings are exhausted.

Consider the version-sort comparison of two file names: `foo07.7z` and
`foo7a.7z`. The two strings will be broken down to the following parts,
and the parts compared respectively from each string:

<div class="example">

``` example
foo  vs  foo   (rule 2, non-digits)
07   vs  7     (rule 3, digits)
.    vs  a.    (rule 2)
7    vs  7     (rule 3)
z    vs  z     (rule 2)
```

</div>

Comparison flow based on above algorithm:

1.  The first parts (‘`foo`’) are identical.
2.  The second parts (‘`07`’ and ‘`7`’) are compared numerically, and
    compare equal.
3.  The third parts (‘`.`’ vs ‘`a.`’) are compared lexically by ASCII
    value (rule 2.B).
4.  The first byte of the first string (‘`.`’) is compared to the first
    byte of the second string (‘`a`’).
5.  Rule 2.B.a says letters sorts before non-letters. Hence, ‘`a`’ comes
    before ‘`.`’.
6.  The returned result is that `foo7a.7z` comes before `foo07.7z`.

Result when using sort:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ cat input3
foo07.7z
foo7a.7z

#### 30.2.2 Version sort is not the same as numeric sort

Consider the following text file:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ cat input4
8.10
8.5
8.1
8.01
8.010
8.100
8.49

Numerical Sort:                   Version Sort:

$ sort -n input4                  $ sort -V input4
8.01                              8.01
8.010                             8.1
8.1                               8.5
8.10                              8.010
8.100                             8.10
8.49                              8.49
8.5                               8.100
```

</div>

Numeric sort (‘`sort -n`’) treats the entire string as a single numeric
value, and compares it to other values. For example, ‘`8.1`’, ‘`8.10`’
and ‘`8.100`’ are numerically equivalent, and are ordered together.
Similarly, ‘`8.49`’ is numerically less than ‘`8.5`’, and appears before
first.

Version sort (‘`sort -V`’) first breaks down the string into digit and
non-digit parts, and only then compares each part (see annotated example
in [Version-sort ordering rules](#Version_002dsort-ordering-rules)).

Comparing the string ‘`8.1`’ to ‘`8.01`’, first the ‘`8`’s are compared
(and are identical), then the dots (‘`.`’) are compared and are
identical, and lastly the remaining digits are compared numerically
(‘`1`’ and ‘`01`’) - which are numerically equal. Hence, ‘`8.01`’ and
‘`8.1`’ are grouped together.

Similarly, comparing ‘`8.5`’ to ‘`8.49`’ – the ‘`8`’ and ‘`.`’ parts are
identical, then the numeric values ‘`5`’ and ‘`49`’ are compared. The
resulting ‘`5`’ appears before ‘`49`’.

This sorting order (where ‘`8.5`’ comes before ‘`8.49`’) is common when
assigning versions to computer programs (while perhaps not intuitive or
“natural” for people).

</div>

<span id="Version-sort-punctuation-1"></span>

#### 30.2.3 Version sort punctuation

Punctuation is sorted by ASCII order (rule 2.B).

<div class="example">

``` example
$ touch 1.0.5_src.tar.gz 1.0_src.tar.gz
$ ls -v -1
1.0.5_src.tar.gz
1.0_src.tar.gz
```

</div>

Why is `1.0.5_src.tar.gz` listed before `1.0_src.tar.gz`?

Based on the version-sort ordering rules, the strings are broken down
into the following parts:

<div class="example">

``` example
          1   vs  1               (rule 3, all digits)
          .   vs  .               (rule 2, all non-digits)
          0   vs  0               (rule 3)
          .   vs  _src.tar.gz     (rule 2)
          5   vs  empty string    (no more bytes in the file name)
_src.tar.gz   vs  empty string
```

</div>

The fourth parts (‘`.`’ and ‘`_src.tar.gz`’) are compared lexically by
ASCII order. The ‘`.`’ (ASCII value 46) is less than ‘`_`’ (ASCII value
95) – and should be listed before it.

Hence, `1.0.5_src.tar.gz` is listed first.

If a different byte appears instead of the underscore (for example,
percent sign ‘`%`’ ASCII value 37, which is less than dot’s ASCII value
of 46), that file will be listed first:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ touch   1.0.5_src.tar.gz     1.0%zzzzz.gz
1.0%zzzzz.gz
1.0.5_src.tar.gz
```

</div>

The same reasoning applies to the following example, as ‘`.`’ with ASCII
value 46 is less than ‘`/`’ with ASCII value 47:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ cat input5
3.0/
3.0.5
$ sort -V input5
3.0.5
3.0/
```

</div>

<span id="Punctuation-vs-letters"></span>

</div>

<span id="Punctuation-vs-letters-1"></span>

#### 30.2.4 Punctuation vs letters

Rule 2.B.a says letters sort before non-letters (after breaking down a
string to digit and non-digit parts).

<div class="example">

``` example
$ cat input6
a%
az
$ sort -V input6
az
a%
```

</div>

The input strings consist entirely of non-digits, and based on the above
algorithm have only one part, all non-digits (‘`a%`’ vs ‘`az`’).

Each part is then compared lexically, byte-by-byte; ‘`a`’ compares
identically in both strings.

Rule 2.B.a says a letter like ‘`z`’ sorts before a non-letter like ‘`%`’
– hence ‘`az`’ appears first (despite ‘`z`’ having ASCII value of 122,
much larger than ‘`%`’ with ASCII value 37).

</div>

<span id="The-tilde-_007e-1"></span>

#### 30.2.5 The tilde ‘`~`’

Rule 2.B.b says the tilde ‘`~`’ (ASCII 126) sorts before other bytes,
and before an empty string.

<div class="example">

``` example
$ cat input7
1
1%
1.2
1~
~
$ sort -V input7
~
1~
1
1%
1.2
```

</div>

The sorting algorithm starts by breaking down the string into non-digit
(rule 2) and digit parts (rule 3).

In the above input file, only the last line in the input file starts
with a non-digit (‘`~`’). This is the first part. All other lines in the
input file start with a digit – their first non-digit part is empty.

Based on rule 2.B.b, tilde ‘`~`’ sorts before other bytes and before the
empty string – hence it comes before all other strings, and is listed
first in the sorted output.

The remaining lines (‘`1`’, ‘`1%`’, ‘`1.2`’, ‘`1~`’) follow similar
logic: The digit part is extracted (1 for all strings) and compares
equal. The following extracted parts for the remaining input lines are:
empty part, ‘`%`’, ‘`.`’, ‘`~`’.

Tilde sorts before all others, hence the line ‘`1~`’ appears next.

The remaining lines (‘`1`’, ‘`1%`’, ‘`1.2`’) are sorted based on
previously explained rules.

</div>

<span id="Version-sort-ignores-locale-1"></span>

#### 30.2.6 Version sort ignores locale

In version sort, Unicode characters are compared byte-by-byte according
to their binary representation, ignoring their Unicode value or the
current locale.

Most commonly, Unicode characters are encoded as UTF-8 bytes; for
example, GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA (U+03B1, ‘`α`’) is encoded as the
UTF-8 sequence ‘`0xCE 0xB1`’). The encoding is compared byte-by-byte,
e.g., first ‘`0xCE`’ (decimal value 206) then ‘`0xB1`’ (decimal value
177).

<div class="example">

``` example
$ touch aa az "a%" "aα"
$ ls -1 -v
aa
az
a%
aα
```

</div>

Ignoring the first letter (‘`a`’) which is identical in all strings, the
compared values are:

‘`a`’ and ‘`z`’ are letters, and sort before all other non-digits.

Then, percent sign ‘`%`’ (ASCII value 37) is compared to the first byte
of the UTF-8 sequence of ‘`α`’, which is 0xCE or 206). The value 37 is
smaller, hence ‘`a%`’ is listed before ‘`aα`’.

### 30.3 Differences from Debian version sort

GNU Coreutils version sort differs slightly from the official Debian
algorithm, in order to accommodate more general usage and file name
listing.

<span id="Hyphen_002dminus-_002d-and-colon-_003a"></span>

#### 30.3.1 Hyphen-minus ‘`-`’ and colon ‘`:`’

In Debian’s version string syntax the version consists of three parts:

<div class="example">

``` example
[epoch:]upstream_version[-debian_revision]
```

</div>

The ‘`epoch`’ and ‘`debian_revision`’ parts are optional.

Example of such version strings:

<div class="example">

``` example
60.7.2esr-1~deb9u1
52.9.0esr-1~deb9u1
1:2.3.4-1+b2
327-2
1:1.0.13-3
2:1.19.2-1+deb9u5
```

</div>

If the ‘`debian_revision part`’ is not present, hyphens ‘`-`’ are not
allowed. If epoch is not present, colons ‘`:`’ are not allowed.

If these parts are present, hyphen and/or colons can appear only once in
valid Debian version strings.

In GNU Coreutils, such restrictions are not reasonable (a file name can
have many hyphens, a line of text can have many colons).

As a result, in GNU Coreutils hyphens and colons are treated exactly
like all other punctuation, i.e., they are sorted after letters. See
[Version sort punctuation](#Version-sort-punctuation).

In Debian, these characters are treated differently than in Coreutils: a
version string with hyphen will sort before similar strings without
hyphens.

Compare:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ touch 1ab-cd 1abb
$ ls -v -1
1abb
1ab-cd
$ if dpkg --compare-versions 1abb lt 1ab-cd
> then echo sorted
> else echo out of order
> fi
out of order
```

</div>

algorithm](#Comparing-two-strings-using-Debian_0027s-algorithm) and [GNU
Bug 35939](https://bugs.gnu.org/35939).

<span id="Special-priority-in-GNU-Coreutils-version-sort-1"></span>

#### 30.3.2 Special priority in GNU Coreutils version sort

In GNU Coreutils version sort, the following items have special priority
and sort before all other strings (listed in order):

1.  The empty string
2.  The string ‘`.`’ (a single dot, ASCII 46)
3.  The string ‘`..`’ (two dots)
4.  Strings starting with dot (‘`.`’) sort before strings starting with
    any other byte.

Example:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ printf '%s\n' a "" b "." c  ".."  ".d20" ".d3"  | sort -V
.
..
.d3
.d20
a
b
c
```

</div>

These priorities make perfect sense for ‘`ls -v`’: The special files dot
‘`.`’ and dot-dot ‘`..`’ will be listed first, followed by any hidden
files (files starting with a dot), followed by non-hidden files.

For ‘`sort -V`’ these priorities might seem arbitrary. However, because
the sorting code is shared between the `ls` and `sort` program, the
ordering rules are the same.

<span id="Special-handling-of-file-extensions-1"></span>

#### 30.3.3 Special handling of file extensions

GNU Coreutils version sort implements specialized handling of strings
that look like file names with extensions. This enables slightly more
natural ordering of file names.

The following additional rules apply when comparing two strings where
both begin with non-‘`.`’. They also apply when comparing two strings
where both begin with ‘`.`’ but neither is ‘`.`’ or ‘`..`’.

1.  A suffix (i.e., a file extension) is defined as: a dot, followed by
    an ASCII letter or tilde, followed by zero or more ASCII letters,
    digits, or tildes; all repeated zero or more times, and ending at
    string end. This is equivalent to matching the extended regular
    expression `(\.[A-Za-z~][A-Za-z0-9~]*)*$` in the C locale.
2.  The suffixes are temporarily removed, and the strings are compared
    without them, using version sort (see [Version-sort ordering
    rules](#Version_002dsort-ordering-rules)) without special priority
    (see [Special priority in GNU Coreutils version
    sort](#Special-priority-in-GNU-Coreutils-version-sort)).
3.  If the suffix-less strings do not compare equal, this comparison
    result is used and the suffixes are effectively ignored.
4.  If the suffix-less strings compare equal, the suffixes are restored
    and the entire strings are compared using version sort.

Examples for rule 1:

-   ‘`hello-8.txt`’: the suffix is ‘`.txt`’
-   ‘`hello-8.2.txt`’: the suffix is ‘`.txt`’ (‘`.2`’ is not included
    because the dot is not followed by a letter)
-   ‘`hello-8.0.12.tar.gz`’: the suffix is ‘`.tar.gz`’ (‘`.0.12`’ is not
    included)
-   ‘`hello-8.2`’: no suffix (suffix is an empty string)
-   ‘`hello.foobar65`’: the suffix is ‘`.foobar65`’
-   ‘`gcc-c++-10.8.12-0.7rc2.fc9.tar.bz2`’: the suffix is
    ‘`.fc9.tar.bz2`’ (‘`.7rc2`’ is not included as it begins with a
    digit)
-   ‘`.autom4te.cfg`’: the suffix is the entire string.

Examples for rule 2:

-   Comparing ‘`hello-8.txt`’ to ‘`hello-8.2.12.txt`’, the ‘`.txt`’
    suffix is temporarily removed from both strings.
-   Comparing ‘`foo-10.3.tar.gz`’ to ‘`foo-10.tar.xz`’, the suffixes
    ‘`.tar.gz`’ and ‘`.tar.xz`’ are temporarily removed from the
    strings.

Example for rule 3:

-   Comparing ‘`hello.foobar65`’ to ‘`hello.foobar4`’, the suffixes
    (‘`.foobar65`’ and ‘`.foobar4`’) are temporarily removed. The
    remaining strings are identical (‘`hello`’). The suffixes are then
    restored, and the entire strings are compared (‘`hello.foobar4`’
    comes first).

Examples for rule 4:

-   When comparing the strings ‘`hello-8.2.txt`’ and ‘`hello-8.10.txt`’,
    the suffixes (‘`.txt`’) are temporarily removed. The remaining
    strings (‘`hello-8.2`’ and ‘`hello-8.10`’) are compared as
    previously described (‘`hello-8.2`’ comes first). *(In this case the
    suffix removal algorithm does not have a noticeable effect on the
    resulting order.)*

**How does the suffix-removal algorithm effect ordering results?**

Consider the comparison of hello-8.txt and hello-8.2.txt.

Without the suffix-removal algorithm, the strings will be broken down to
the following parts:

<div class="example">

``` example
hello-  vs  hello-  (rule 2, all non-digits)
8       vs  8       (rule 3, all digits)
.txt    vs  .       (rule 2)
empty   vs  2
empty   vs  .txt
```

</div>

The comparison of the third parts (‘`.`’ vs ‘`.txt`’) will determine
that the shorter string comes first - resulting in `hello-8.2.txt`
appearing first.

Indeed this is the order in which Debian’s `dpkg` compares the strings.

A more natural result is that `hello-8.txt` should come before
`hello-8.2.txt`, and this is where the suffix-removal comes into play:

The suffixes (‘`.txt`’) are removed, and the remaining strings are
broken down into the following parts:

<div class="example">

``` example
hello-  vs  hello-  (rule 2, all non-digits)
8       vs  8       (rule 3, all digits)
empty   vs  .       (rule 2)
empty   vs  2
```

</div>

As empty strings sort before non-empty strings, the result is
‘`hello-8`’ being first.

A real-world example would be listing files such as: `gcc_10.fc9.tar.gz`
and `gcc_10.8.12.7rc2.fc9.tar.bz2`: Debian’s algorithm would list
`gcc_10.8.12.7rc2.fc9.tar.bz2` first, while ‘`ls -v`’ will list
`gcc_10.fc9.tar.gz` first.

These priorities make sense for ‘`ls -v`’: Versioned files will be
listed in a more natural order.

For ‘`sort -V`’ these priorities might seem arbitrary. However, because
the sorting code is shared between the `ls` and `sort` program, the
ordering rules are the same.

#### 30.3.4 Comparing two strings using Debian’s algorithm

The Debian program `dpkg` (available on all Debian and Ubuntu
installations) can compare two strings using the `--compare-versions`
option.

To use it, create a helper shell function (simply copy & paste the
following snippet to your shell command-prompt):

<div class="example">

``` example
compver() {
  if dpkg --compare-versions "$1" lt "$2"
  then printf '%s\n' "$1" "$2"
  else printf '%s\n' "$2" "$1"
  fi
}
```

</div>

Then compare two strings by calling `compver`:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ compver 8.49 8.5
8.5
8.49
```

</div>

Note that `dpkg` will warn if the strings have invalid syntax:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ compver "foo07.7z" "foo7a.7z"
dpkg: warning: version 'foo07.7z' has bad syntax:
               version number does not start with digit
dpkg: warning: version 'foo7a.7z' has bad syntax:
               version number does not start with digit
foo7a.7z
foo07.7z
$ compver "3.0/" "3.0.5"
dpkg: warning: version '3.0/' has bad syntax:
               invalid character in version number
3.0.5
3.0/
```

</div>

To illustrate the different handling of hyphens between Debian and
Coreutils algorithms (see [Hyphen-minus and
colon](#Hyphen_002dminus-and-colon)):

<div class="example">

``` example
$ compver abb ab-cd 2>/dev/null     $ printf 'abb\nab-cd\n' | sort -V
ab-cd                               abb
abb                                 ab-cd
```

To illustrate the different handling of file extension: (see [Special
handling of file extensions](#Special-handling-of-file-extensions)):

<div class="example">

``` example
$ compver hello-8.txt hello-8.2.txt 2>/dev/null

#### 30.4.1 Reporting version sort bugs

If you suspect a bug in GNU Coreutils version sort (i.e., in the output
of ‘`ls -v`’ or ‘`sort -V`’), please first check the following:

1.  Is the result consistent with Debian’s own ordering (using `dpkg`,
    see [Comparing two strings using Debian's
    algorithm](#Comparing-two-strings-using-Debian_0027s-algorithm))? If
    it is, then this is not a bug – please do not report it.
2.  If the result differs from Debian’s, is it explained by one of the
    sections in [Differences from Debian version
    sort](#Differences-from-Debian-version-sort)? If it is, then this is
    not a bug – please do not report it.
3.  If you have a question about specific ordering which is not
    explained here, please write to <coreutils@gnu.org>, and provide a
    concise example that will help us diagnose the issue.
4.  If you still suspect a bug which is not explained by the above,
    please write to <bug-coreutils@gnu.org> with a concrete example of
    the suspected incorrect output, with details on why you think it is
    incorrect.

#### 30.4.2 Other version/natural sort implementations

As previously mentioned, there are multiple variations on
version/natural sort, each with its own rules. Some examples are:

-   Natural Sorting variants in [Rosetta
    Code](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Natural_sorting).
-   Python’s [natsort package](https://pypi.org/project/natsort/)
    (includes detailed description of their sorting rules: [natsort –
    how it
    works](https://natsort.readthedocs.io/en/master/howitworks.html)).
-   Ruby’s [version_sorter](https://github.com/github/version_sorter).
-   Perl has multiple packages for natual and version sorts (each likely
    with its own rules and nuances):
    [Sort::Naturally](https://metacpan.org/pod/Sort::Naturally),
    [Sort::Versions](https://metacpan.org/pod/Sort::Versions),
    [CPAN::Version](https://metacpan.org/pod/CPAN::Version).
-   PHP has a built-in function
    [natsort](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.natsort.php).
-   NodeJS’s [natural-sort
    package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/natural-sort).
-   In zsh, the [glob
    modifier](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Expansion.html#Glob-Qualifiers)
    ‘`*(n)`’ will expand to files in natural sort order.
-   When writing C programs, the GNU libc library (‘`glibc`’) provides
    the
    [strvercmp(3)](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strverscmp.3.html)
    function to compare two strings, and
    [versionsort(3)](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/versionsort.3.html)
    function to compare two directory entries (despite the names, they
    are not identical to GNU Coreutils version sort ordering).
-   Using Debian’s sorting algorithm in:
    -   python: [Stack Overflow Example
        \#4957741](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4957741).
    -   NodeJS:
        [deb-version-compare](https://www.npmjs.com/package/deb-version-compare).

### Toolbox Introduction

This month’s column is only peripherally related to the GNU Project, in
that it describes a number of the GNU tools on your GNU/Linux system and
how they might be used. What it’s really about is the “Software Tools”
philosophy of program development and usage.

The software tools philosophy was an important and integral concept in
the initial design and development of Unix (of which GNU/Linux and GNU
are essentially clones). Unfortunately, in the modern day press of
Internetworking and flashy GUIs, it seems to have fallen by the wayside.
This is a shame, since it provides a powerful mental model for solving
many kinds of problems.

Many people carry a Swiss Army knife around in their pants pockets (or
purse). A Swiss Army knife is a handy tool to have: it has several knife
blades, a screwdriver, tweezers, toothpick, nail file, corkscrew, and
perhaps a number of other things on it. For the everyday, small
miscellaneous jobs where you need a simple, general purpose tool, it’s
just the thing.

On the other hand, an experienced carpenter doesn’t build a house using
a Swiss Army knife. Instead, he has a toolbox chock full of specialized
tools—a saw, a hammer, a screwdriver, a plane, and so on. And he knows
exactly when and where to use each tool; you won’t catch him hammering
nails with the handle of his screwdriver.

The Unix developers at Bell Labs were all professional programmers and
trained computer scientists. They had found that while a
one-size-fits-all program might appeal to a user because there’s only
one program to use, in practice such programs are

1.  difficult to write,
2.  difficult to maintain and debug, and
3.  difficult to extend to meet new situations.

Instead, they felt that programs should be specialized tools. In short,
each program “should do one thing well.” No more and no less. Such
programs are simpler to design, write, and get right—they only do one
thing.

Furthermore, they found that with the right machinery for hooking
programs together, that the whole was greater than the sum of the parts.
By combining several special purpose programs, you could accomplish a
specific task that none of the programs was designed for, and accomplish
it much more quickly and easily than if you had to write a special
purpose program. We will see some (classic) examples of this further on
in the column. (An important additional point was that, if necessary,
take a detour and build any software tools you may need first, if you
don’t already have something appropriate in the toolbox.)

<span id="I_002fO-Redirection"></span>

### I/O Redirection

Hopefully, you are familiar with the basics of I/O redirection in the
shell, in particular the concepts of “standard input,” “standard
output,” and “standard error”. Briefly, “standard input” is a data
source, where data comes from. A program should not need to either know
or care if the data source is a regular file, a keyboard, a magnetic
tape, or even a punched card reader. Similarly, “standard output” is a
data sink, where data goes to. The program should neither know nor care
where this might be. Programs that only read their standard input, do
something to the data, and then send it on, are called *filters*, by
analogy to filters in a water pipeline.

With the Unix shell, it’s very easy to set up data pipelines:

<div class="example">

``` example
program_to_create_data | filter1 | ... | filterN > final.pretty.data
```

</div>

We start out by creating the raw data; each filter applies some
successive transformation to the data, until by the time it comes out of
the pipeline, it is in the desired form.

This is fine and good for standard input and standard output. Where does
the standard error come in to play? Well, think about `filter1` in the
pipeline above. What happens if it encounters an error in the data it
sees? If it writes an error message to standard output, it will just
disappear down the pipeline into `filter2`’s input, and the user will
probably never see it. So programs need a place where they can send
error messages so that the user will notice them. This is standard
error, and it is usually connected to your console or window, even if
you have redirected standard output of your program away from your
screen.

For filter programs to work together, the format of the data has to be
agreed upon. The most straightforward and easiest format to use is
simply lines of text. Unix data files are generally just streams of
bytes, with lines delimited by the ASCII LF (Line Feed) character,
conventionally called a “newline” in the Unix literature. (This is
`'\n'` if you’re a C programmer.) This is the format used by all the
traditional filtering programs. (Many earlier operating systems had
elaborate facilities and special purpose programs for managing binary
data. Unix has always shied away from such things, under the philosophy
that it’s easiest to simply be able to view and edit your data with a
text editor.)

OK, enough introduction. Let’s take a look at some of the tools, and
then we’ll see how to hook them together in interesting ways. In the
following discussion, we will only present those command line options
that interest us. As you should always do, double check your system
documentation for the full story.

</div>

<span id="The-who-Command"></span>

### The `who` Command

The first program is the `who` command. By itself, it generates a list
of the users who are currently logged in. Although I’m writing this on a
single-user system, we’ll pretend that several people are logged in:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ who
-| arnold   console Jan 22 19:57
-| miriam   ttyp0   Jan 23 14:19(:0.0)
-| bill     ttyp1   Jan 21 09:32(:0.0)
-| arnold   ttyp2   Jan 23 20:48(:0.0)
```

</div>

Here, the ‘`$`’ is the usual shell prompt, at which I typed ‘`who`’.
There are three people logged in, and I am logged in twice. On
traditional Unix systems, user names are never more than eight
characters long. This little bit of trivia will be useful later. The
output of `who` is nice, but the data is not all that exciting.

title="Table of contents">Contents</a>\]\[<a href="#Concept-index" rel="index" title="Index">Index</a>\]

</div>

<span id="The-cut-Command"></span>

### The `cut` Command

The next program we’ll look at is the `cut` command. This program cuts
out columns or fields of input data. For example, we can tell it to
print just the login name and full name from the `/etc/passwd` file. The
`/etc/passwd` file has seven fields, separated by colons:

<div class="example">

``` example
arnold:xyzzy:2076:10:Arnold D. Robbins:/home/arnold:/bin/bash
```

</div>

To get the first and fifth fields, we would use `cut` like this:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ cut -d: -f1,5 /etc/passwd
-| root:Operator
…
-| arnold:Arnold D. Robbins
-| miriam:Miriam A. Robbins
…
```

</div>

With the `-c` option, `cut` will cut out specific characters (i.e.,
columns) in the input lines. This is useful for input data that has
fixed width fields, and does not have a field separator. For example,
list the Monday dates for the current month:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ cal | cut -c 3-5
-|Mo
-|
-|  6
-| 13
-| 20
-| 27
```

</div>

</div>

<span id="The-sort-Command"></span>

### The `sort` Command

Next we’ll look at the `sort` command. This is one of the most powerful
commands on a Unix-style system; one that you will often find yourself
using when setting up fancy data plumbing.

The `sort` command reads and sorts each file named on the command line.
It then merges the sorted data and writes it to standard output. It will
read standard input if no files are given on the command line (thus
making it into a filter). The sort is based on the character collating
sequence or based on user-supplied ordering criteria.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span id="The-uniq-command"></span>

<div class="header">

Next:

title="Table of contents">Contents</a>\]\[<a href="#Concept-index" rel="index" title="Index">Index</a>\]

</div>

<span id="The-uniq-Command"></span>

### The `uniq` Command

Finally (at least for now), we’ll look at the `uniq` program. When
sorting data, you will often end up with duplicate lines, lines that are
identical. Usually, all you need is one instance of each line. This is
where `uniq` comes in. The `uniq` program reads its standard input. It
prints only one copy of each repeated line. It does have several
options. Later on, we’ll use the `-c` option, which prints each unique
line, preceded by a count of the number of times that line occurred in
the input.

</div>

<span id="Putting-the-Tools-Together"></span>

### Putting the Tools Together

Now, let’s suppose this is a large ISP server system with dozens of
users logged in. The management wants the system administrator to write
a program that will generate a sorted list of logged in users.
Furthermore, even if a user is logged in multiple times, his or her name
should only show up in the output once.

The administrator could sit down with the system documentation and write
a C program that did this. It would take perhaps a couple of hundred
lines of code and about two hours to write it, test it, and debug it.
However, knowing the software toolbox, the administrator can instead
start out by generating just a list of logged on users:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ who | cut -c1-8
-| arnold
-| miriam
-| bill
-| arnold
```

</div>

Next, sort the list:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ who | cut -c1-8 | sort
-| arnold
-| arnold
-| bill
-| miriam
```

</div>

Finally, run the sorted list through `uniq`, to weed out duplicates:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ who | cut -c1-8 | sort | uniq
-| arnold
-| bill
-| miriam
```

</div>

The `sort` command actually has a `-u` option that does what `uniq`
does. However, `uniq` has other uses for which one cannot substitute
‘`sort -u`’.

The administrator puts this pipeline into a shell script, and makes it
available for all the users on the system (‘`#`’ is the system
administrator, or `root`, prompt):

<div class="example">

``` example
# cat > /usr/local/bin/listusers
who | cut -c1-8 | sort | uniq
^D
# chmod +x /usr/local/bin/listusers
```

</div>

There are four major points to note here. First, with just four
programs, on one command line, the administrator was able to save about
two hours worth of work. Furthermore, the shell pipeline is just about
as efficient as the C program would be, and it is much more efficient in
terms of programmer time. People time is much more expensive than
computer time, and in our modern “there’s never enough time to do
everything” society, saving two hours of programmer time is no mean
feat.

Second, it is also important to emphasize that with the *combination* of
the tools, it is possible to do a special purpose job never imagined by
the authors of the individual programs.

Third, it is also valuable to build up your pipeline in stages, as we
did here. This allows you to view the data at each stage in the
pipeline, which helps you acquire the confidence that you are indeed
using these tools correctly.

Finally, by bundling the pipeline in a shell script, other users can use
your command, without having to remember the fancy plumbing you set up
for them. In terms of how you run them, shell scripts and compiled
programs are indistinguishable.

After the previous warm-up exercise, we’ll look at two additional, more
complicated pipelines. For them, we need to introduce two more tools.

The first is the `tr` command, which stands for “transliterate.” The
`tr` command works on a character-by-character basis, changing
characters. Normally it is used for things like mapping upper case to
lower case:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ echo ThIs ExAmPlE HaS MIXED case! | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'
-| this example has mixed case!
```

</div>

There are several options of interest:

`-c`  
work on the complement of the listed characters, i.e., operations apply
to characters not in the given set

`-d`  
delete characters in the first set from the output

`-s`  
squeeze repeated characters in the output into just one character.

We will be using all three options in a moment.

The other command we’ll look at is `comm`. The `comm` command takes two
sorted input files as input data, and prints out the files’ lines in
three columns. The output columns are the data lines unique to the first
file, the data lines unique to the second file, and the data lines that
are common to both. The `-1`, `-2`, and `-3` command line options *omit*
the respective columns. (This is non-intuitive and takes a little
getting used to.) For example:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ cat f1
-| 11111
-| 22222
-| 33333
-| 44444
$ cat f2
-| 00000
-| 22222
-| 33333
-| 55555
$ comm f1 f2

```

</div>

The file name `-` tells `comm` to read standard input instead of a
regular file.

Now we’re ready to build a fancy pipeline. The first application is a
word frequency counter. This helps an author determine if he or she is
over-using certain words.

The first step is to change the case of all the letters in our input
file to one case. “The” and “the” are the same word when doing counting.

<div class="example">

``` example
$ tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' < whats.gnu | ...
```

</div>

The next step is to get rid of punctuation. Quoted words and unquoted
words should be treated identically; it’s easiest to just get the
punctuation out of the way.

<div class="example">

``` example
$ tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' < whats.gnu | tr -cd '[:alnum:]_ \n' | ...
```

</div>

The second `tr` command operates on the complement of the listed
characters, which are all the letters, the digits, the underscore, and
the blank. The ‘`\n`’ represents the newline character; it has to be
left alone. (The ASCII tab character should also be included for good
measure in a production script.)

At this point, we have data consisting of words separated by blank
space. The words only contain alphanumeric characters (and the
underscore). The next step is break the data apart so that we have one
word per line. This makes the counting operation much easier, as we will
see shortly.

<div class="example">

``` example
$ tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' < whats.gnu | tr -cd '[:alnum:]_ \n' |
> tr -s ' ' '\n' | ...
```

</div>

This command turns blanks into newlines. The `-s` option squeezes
multiple newline characters in the output into just one, removing blank
lines. (The ‘`>`’ is the shell’s “secondary prompt.” This is what the
shell prints when it notices you haven’t finished typing in all of a
command.)

We now have data consisting of one word per line, no punctuation, all
one case. We’re ready to count each word:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' < whats.gnu | tr -cd '[:alnum:]_ \n' |
> tr -s ' ' '\n' | sort | uniq -c | ...
```

</div>

At this point, the data might look something like this:

<div class="example">

``` example
     60 a
      2 able
      6 about
      1 above
      2 accomplish
      1 acquire
      1 actually
      2 additional
```

</div>

The output is sorted by word, not by count! What we want is the most
frequently used words first. Fortunately, this is easy to accomplish,
with the help of two more `sort` options:

`-n`  
do a numeric sort, not a textual one

`-r`  
reverse the order of the sort

The final pipeline looks like this:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' < whats.gnu | tr -cd '[:alnum:]_ \n' |
> tr -s ' ' '\n' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n -r
-|    156 the
-|     60 a
-|     58 to
-|     51 of
-|     51 and
…
```

</div>

Whew! That’s a lot to digest. Yet, the same principles apply. With six
commands, on two lines (really one long one split for convenience),
we’ve created a program that does something interesting and useful, in
much less time than we could have written a C program to do the same
thing.

A minor modification to the above pipeline can give us a simple spelling
checker! To determine if you’ve spelled a word correctly, all you have
to do is look it up in a dictionary. If it is not there, then chances
are that your spelling is incorrect. So, we need a dictionary. The
conventional location for a dictionary is `/usr/share/dict/words`.

Now, how to compare our file with the dictionary? As before, we generate
a sorted list of words, one per line:

<div class="example">

``` example
$ tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' < whats.gnu | tr -cd '[:alnum:]_ \n' |
> tr -s ' ' '\n' | sort -u | ...
```

</div>

Now, all we need is a list of words that are *not* in the dictionary.
Here is where the `comm` command comes in. Unfortunately `comm` operates
on sorted input and `/usr/share/dict/words` is not sorted the way that
`sort` and `comm` normally use, so we first create a properly-sorted
copy of the dictionary and then run a pipeline that uses the copy.

<div class="example">

``` example
$ sort /usr/share/dict/words > sorted-words
$ tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' < whats.gnu | tr -cd '[:alnum:]_ \n' |
> tr -s ' ' '\n' | sort -u |
> comm -23 - sorted-words
```

</div>

The `-2` and `-3` options eliminate lines that are only in the
dictionary (the second file), and lines that are in both files. Lines
only in the first file (standard input, our stream of words), are words
that are not in the dictionary. These are likely candidates for spelling
errors. This pipeline was the first cut at a production spelling checker
on Unix.

There are some other tools that deserve brief mention.

`grep`  
search files for text that matches a regular expression

`wc`  
count lines, words, characters

`tee`  
a T-fitting for data pipes, copies data to files and to standard output

`sed`  
the stream editor, an advanced tool

`awk`  
a data manipulation language, another advanced tool

The software tools philosophy also espoused the following bit of advice:
“Let someone else do the hard part.” This means, take something that
gives you most of what you need, and then massage it the rest of the way
until it’s in the form that you want.

To summarize:

1.  Each program should do one thing well. No more, no less.
2.  Combining programs with appropriate plumbing leads to results where
    the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. It also leads to
    novel uses of programs that the authors might never have imagined.
3.  Programs should never print extraneous header or trailer data, since
    these could get sent on down a pipeline. (A point we didn’t mention
    earlier.)
4.  Let someone else do the hard part.
5.  Know your toolbox! Use each program appropriately. If you don’t have
    an appropriate tool, build one.

All the programs discussed are available as described in [GNU core
utilities](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/coreutils.html).

None of what I have presented in this column is new. The Software Tools
philosophy was first introduced in the book Software Tools, by Brian
Kernighan and P.J. Plauger (Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-03669-X). This
book showed how to write and use software tools. It was written in 1976,
using a preprocessor for FORTRAN named `ratfor` (RATional FORtran). At
the time, C was not as ubiquitous as it is now; FORTRAN was. The last
chapter presented a `ratfor` to FORTRAN processor, written in `ratfor`.
`ratfor` looks an awful lot like C; if you know C, you won’t have any
problem following the code.

In 1981, the book was updated and made available as Software Tools in
Pascal (Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-10342-7). Both books are still in
print and are well worth reading if you’re a programmer. They certainly
made a major change in how I view programming.

The programs in both books are available from [Brian Kernighan’s home
page](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~bwk/). For a number of years, there
was an active Software Tools Users Group, whose members had ported the
original `ratfor` programs to essentially every computer system with a
FORTRAN compiler. The popularity of the group waned in the middle 1980s
as Unix began to spread beyond universities.

With the current proliferation of GNU code and other clones of Unix
programs, these programs now receive little attention; modern C versions
are much more efficient and do more than these programs do.
Nevertheless, as exposition of good programming style, and evangelism
for a still-valuable philosophy, these books are unparalleled, and I
recommend them highly.

Acknowledgment: I would like to express my gratitude to Brian Kernighan
of Bell Labs, the original Software Toolsmith, for reviewing this
column.

Copyright © 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

</div>

0.  PREAMBLE

    The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
    functional and useful document *free* in the sense of freedom: to
    assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
    with or without modifying it, either commercially or
    noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author
    and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being
    considered responsible for modifications made by others.

    This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative
    works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It
    complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
    license designed for free software.

    We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
    free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
    free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
    that the software does. But this License is not limited to software
    manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject
    matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend
    this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or
    reference.

1.  APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

    This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
    that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
    be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants
    a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use
    that work under the conditions stated herein. The “Document”, below,
    refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a
    licensee, and is addressed as “you”. You accept the license if you
    copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
    under copyright law.

    A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the
    Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
    modifications and/or translated into another language.

    A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section
    of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
    publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall
    subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
    directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in
    part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
    any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical
    connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
    commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
    them.

    The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
    are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
    that says that the Document is released under this License. If a
    section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is
    not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain
    zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any
    Invariant Sections then there are none.

    The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are
    listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that
    says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover
    Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25
    words.

    A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
    represented in a format whose specification is available to the
    general public, that is suitable for revising the document
    straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
    of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
    available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
    formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
    suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise
    Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been
    arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers
    is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for
    any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not “Transparent” is
    called “Opaque”.

    Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
    ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
    or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
    simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
    Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
    Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
    edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
    the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the
    machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
    processors for output purposes only.

    The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
    plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
    material this License requires to appear in the title page. For
    works in formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title
    Page” means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
    work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

    The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies
    of the Document to the public.

    A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document whose
    title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
    following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ
    stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
    “Acknowledgements”, “Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.) To
    “Preserve the Title” of such a section when you modify the Document
    means that it remains a section “Entitled XYZ” according to this
    definition.

    The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
    which states that this License applies to the Document. These
    Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
    this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
    implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
    no effect on the meaning of this License.

2.  VERBATIM COPYING

    You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
    commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
    copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
    applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
    add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may
    not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or
    further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you
    may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a
    large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in
    section 3.

    You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
    and you may publicly display copies.

3.  COPYING IN QUANTITY

    If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
    printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
    Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
    copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
    Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
    the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
    you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present
    the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
    visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.
    Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
    the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be
    treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

    If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
    legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
    reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
    pages.

    If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
    more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
    Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
    each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
    network-using public has access to download using public-standard
    network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
    of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take
    reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
    copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain
    thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after
    the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through
    your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

    It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
    the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
    to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
    Document.

4.  MODIFICATIONS

    You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
    the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
    the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
    Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
    distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
    possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the
    Modified Version:

    1.  Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
        distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
        versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
        History section of the Document). You may use the same title as
        a previous version if the original publisher of that version
        gives permission.
    2.  List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
        entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the
        Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal
        authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has
        fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.
    3.  State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
        Modified Version, as the publisher.
    4.  Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
    5.  Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
        adjacent to the other copyright notices.
    6.  Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
        notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version
        under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the
        Addendum below.
    7.  Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
        Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s
        license notice.
    8.  Include an unaltered copy of this License.
    9.  Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title, and
        add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors,
        and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title
        Page. If there is no section Entitled “History” in the Document,
        create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of
        the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item
        describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous
        sentence.
    10. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
        public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
        likewise the network locations given in the Document for
        previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the
        “History” section. You may omit a network location for a work
        that was published at least four years before the Document
        itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to
        gives permission.
    11. For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”,
        Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
        all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
        acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.
    12. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
        in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the
        equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
    13. Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”. Such a section may
        not be included in the Modified Version.
    14. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
        “Endorsements” or to conflict in title with any Invariant
        Section.
    15. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

    If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
    appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
    material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
    some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their
    titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s
    license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section
    titles.

    You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains
    nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
    parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
    been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of
    a standard.

    You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and
    a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the
    list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of
    Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
    through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document
    already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
    by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
    behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one,
    on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the
    old one.

    The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
    License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
    assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

5.  COMBINING DOCUMENTS

    You may combine the Document with other documents released under
    this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
    modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
    of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
    unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined
    work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty
    Disclaimers.

    The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
    multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
    copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
    but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
    by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
    author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique
    number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list
    of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

    In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled “History”
    in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
    “History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled
    “Acknowledgements”, and any sections Entitled “Dedications”. You
    must delete all sections Entitled “Endorsements.”

6.  COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

    You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
    documents released under this License, and replace the individual
    copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
    that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
    rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
    in all other respects.

    You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
    distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
    copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
    License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
    document.

7.  AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

    A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
    and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage
    or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the copyright
    resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
    of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit.
    When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
    apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
    derivative works of the Document.

    If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
    copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
    of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed on
    covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
    electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
    form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the
    whole aggregate.

8.  TRANSLATION

    Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
    distribute translations of the Document under the terms of
    section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires
    special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
    translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
    original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a
    translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
    Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
    include the original English version of this License and the
    original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a
    disagreement between the translation and the original version of
    this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
    prevail.

    If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
    “Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
    its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
    title.

9.  TERMINATION

    You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
    will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

    However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
    license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
    provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
    finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
    copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
    reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

    Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
    reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
    violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
    received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
    that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
    after your receipt of the notice.

    Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
    licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
    under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not
    permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same
    material does not give you any rights to use it.

10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

    The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
    the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new
    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See
    <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

    Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
    number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version
    of this License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the
    option of following the terms and conditions either of that
    specified version or of any later version that has been published
    (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document
    does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
    any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software
    Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which
    future versions of this License can be used, that proxy’s public
    statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to
    choose that version for the Document.

11. RELICENSING

    “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any
    World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
    provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A
    public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A
    “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the site
    means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.

    “CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
    license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
    corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
    California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
    published by that same organization.

    “Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
    in part, as part of another Document.

    An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this
    License, and if all works that were first published under this
    License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated
    in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or
    invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November
    1, 2008.

    The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
    site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
    2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

### ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

<div class="example">

``` example
  Copyright (C)  year  your name.
  Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
  under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
  or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
  with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
  Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
  Free Documentation License''.
```

</div>

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the “with…Texts.” line with this:

<div class="example">

``` example
    with the Invariant Sections being list their titles, with
    the Front-Cover Texts being list, and with the Back-Cover Texts
    being list.
```

</div>

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.

#### Footnotes

<a href="#DOCF1" id="FOOT1">(1)</a>

Using a number as a user name is common in some environments.

<a href="#DOCF2" id="FOOT2">(2)</a>

If you use a non-POSIX locale (e.g., by setting `LC_ALL` to ‘`en_US`’),
then `sort` may produce output that is sorted differently than you’re
accustomed to. In that case, set the `LC_ALL` environment variable to
‘`C`’. Note that setting only `LC_COLLATE` has two problems. First, it
is ineffective if `LC_ALL` is also set. Second, it has undefined
behavior if `LC_CTYPE` (or `LANG`, if `LC_CTYPE` is unset) is set to an
incompatible value. For example, you get undefined behavior if
`LC_CTYPE` is `ja_JP.PCK` but `LC_COLLATE` is `en_US.UTF-8`.

<a href="#DOCF3" id="FOOT3">(3)</a>

the `$'\t'` is supported in most modern shells. For older shells, use a
literal tab

<a href="#DOCF4" id="FOOT4">(4)</a>

If you use a non-POSIX locale (e.g., by setting `LC_ALL` to ‘`en_US`’),
then `ls` may produce output that is sorted differently than you’re
accustomed to. In that case, set the `LC_ALL` environment variable to
‘`C`’.

<a href="#DOCF5" id="FOOT5">(5)</a>

However, some systems (e.g., FreeBSD) can be configured to allow certain
regular users to use the `chroot` system call, and hence to run this
program. Also, on Cygwin, anyone can run the `chroot` command, because
the underlying function is non-privileged due to lack of support in
MS-Windows. Furthermore, the `chroot` command avoids the `chroot` system
call when `newroot` is identical to the old `/` directory for
consistency with systems where this is allowed for non-privileged users.
