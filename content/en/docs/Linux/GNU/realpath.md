# ‘realpath’: Print the resolved file name.

‘realpath’ expands all symbolic links and resolves references to ‘/./’,
‘/../’ and extra ‘/’ characters. By default, all but the last
component of the specified files must exist.
Synopsis:

``` 
 realpath [OPTION]... FILE...
```

The file name canonicalization functionality overlaps with that of the
‘readlink’ command. This is the preferred command for canonicalization
as it’s a more suitable and standard name. In addition this command
supports relative file name processing functionality.

The program accepts the following options. Also see \*note Common
options::.

‘-e’ ‘--canonicalize-existing’ Ensure that all components of the
specified file names exist. If any component is missing or unavailable,
‘realpath’ will output a diagnostic unless the ‘-q’ option is
specified, and exit with a nonzero exit code. A trailing slash requires
that the name resolve to a directory.

‘-m’ ‘--canonicalize-missing’ If any component of a specified file name
is missing or unavailable, treat it as a directory.

‘-L’ ‘--logical’ Symbolic links are resolved in the specified file
names, but they are resolved after any subsequent ‘..’ components are
processed.

‘-P’ ‘--physical’ Symbolic links are resolved in the specified file
names, and they are resolved before any subsequent ‘..’ components are
processed. This is the default mode of operation.

‘-q’ ‘--quiet’ Suppress diagnostic messages for specified file names.

‘--relative-to=DIR’ Print the resolved file names relative to the
specified directory. Note this option honors the ‘-m’ and ‘-e’ options
pertaining to file existence.

‘--relative-base=DIR’ Print the resolved file names as relative *if* the
files are descendants of DIR. Otherwise, print the resolved file names
as absolute. Note this option honors the ‘-m’ and ‘-e’ options
pertaining to file existence. For details about combining
‘--relative-to’ and ‘--relative-base’, \*note Realpath usage
examples::.

‘-s’ ‘--strip’ ‘--no-symlinks’ Do not resolve symbolic links. Only
resolve references to ‘/./’, ‘/../’ and remove extra ‘/’ characters.
When combined with the ‘-m’ option, realpath operates only on the file
name, and does not touch any actual file.

‘-z’ ‘--zero’ Output a zero byte (ASCII NUL) at the end of each line,
rather than a newline. This option enables other programs to parse the
output even when that output would contain data with embedded newlines.

Exit status:

``` 
 0 if all file names were printed without issue.
 1 otherwise.
```

## Realpath usage examples

By default, ‘realpath’ prints the absolute file name of given files
(symlinks are resolved, ‘words’ is resolved to ‘american-english’):

``` 
 cd /home/user
 realpath /usr/bin/sort /tmp/foo /usr/share/dict/words 1.txt
 ⇒ /usr/bin/sort
 ⇒ /tmp/foo
 ⇒ /usr/share/dict/american-english
 ⇒ /home/user/1.txt
```

With ‘--relative-to’, file names are printed relative to the given
directory:

``` 
 realpath --relative-to=/usr/bin \
          /usr/bin/sort /tmp/foo /usr/share/dict/words 1.txt
 ⇒ sort
 ⇒ ../../tmp/foo
 ⇒ ../share/dict/american-english
 ⇒ ../../home/user/1.txt
```

With ‘--relative-base’, relative file names are printed *if* the
resolved file name is below the given base directory. For files outside
the base directory absolute file names are printed:

``` 
 realpath --relative-base=/usr \
          /usr/bin/sort /tmp/foo /usr/share/dict/words 1.txt
 ⇒ bin/sort
 ⇒ /tmp/foo
 ⇒ share/dict/american-english
 ⇒ /home/user/1.txt
```

When both ‘--relative-to=DIR1’ and ‘--relative-base=DIR2’ are used, file
names are printed relative to DIR1 *if* they are located below DIR2. If
the files are not below DIR2, they are printed as absolute file names:

``` 
 realpath --relative-to=/usr/bin --relative-base=/usr \
          /usr/bin/sort /tmp/foo /usr/share/dict/words 1.txt
 ⇒ sort
 ⇒ /tmp/foo
 ⇒ ../share/dict/american-english
 ⇒ /home/user/1.txt
```

When both ‘--relative-to=DIR1’ and ‘--relative-base=DIR2’ are used, DIR1
*must* be a subdirectory of DIR2. Otherwise, ‘realpath’ prints absolutes
file names.
