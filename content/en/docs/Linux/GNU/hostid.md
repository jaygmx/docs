# ‘hostid’: Print numeric host identifier

‘hostid’ prints the numeric identifier of the current host in
hexadecimal. This command accepts no arguments. The only options are
‘--help’ and ‘--version’. \*Note Common options::.

For example, here’s what it prints on one system I use:

``` 
 $ hostid
 1bac013d
```

On that system, the 32-bit quantity happens to be closely related to the
system’s Internet address, but that isn’t always the case.

‘hostid’ is installed only on systems that have the ‘gethostid’
function, so portable scripts should not rely on its existence.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.
