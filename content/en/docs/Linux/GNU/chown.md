# ‘chown’: Change file owner and group

‘chown’ changes the user and/or group ownership of each given FILE to
NEW-OWNER or to the user and group of an existing reference file.
Synopsis:

``` 
 chown [OPTION]... {NEW-OWNER | --reference=REF_FILE} FILE...
```

If used, NEW-OWNER specifies the new owner and/or group as follows (with
no embedded white space):

``` 
 [OWNER] [ : [GROUP] ]
```

Specifically:

OWNER If only an OWNER (a user name or numeric user ID) is given, that
user is made the owner of each given file, and the files’ group is not
changed.

OWNER‘:’GROUP If the OWNER is followed by a colon and a GROUP (a group
name or numeric group ID), with no spaces between them, the group
ownership of the files is changed as well (to GROUP).

OWNER‘:’ If a colon but no group name follows OWNER, that user is made
the owner of the files and the group of the files is changed to OWNER’s
login group.

‘:’GROUP If the colon and following GROUP are given, but the owner is
omitted, only the group of the files is changed; in this case, ‘chown’
performs the same function as ‘chgrp’.

‘:’ If only a colon is given, or if NEW-OWNER is empty, neither the
owner nor the group is changed.

If OWNER or GROUP is intended to represent a numeric user or group ID,
then you may specify it with a leading ‘+’. \*Note Disambiguating names
and IDs::.

Some older scripts may still use ‘.’ in place of the ‘:’ separator.
POSIX 1003.1-2001 (\*note Standards conformance::) does not require
support for that, but for backward compatibility GNU ‘chown’ supports
‘.’ so long as no ambiguity results. New scripts should avoid the
use of ‘.’ because it is not portable, and because it has undesirable
results if the entire OWNER‘.’GROUP happens to identify a user whose
name contains ‘.’.

It is system dependent whether a user can change the group to an
arbitrary one, or the more portable behavior of being restricted to
setting a group of which the user is a member.

The ‘chown’ command sometimes clears the set-user-ID or set-group-ID
permission bits. This behavior depends on the policy and functionality
of the underlying ‘chown’ system call, which may make system-dependent
file mode modifications outside the control of the ‘chown’ command. For
example, the ‘chown’ command might not affect those bits when invoked by
a user with appropriate privileges, or when the bits signify some
function other than executable permission (e.g., mandatory locking).
When in doubt, check the underlying system behavior.

The program accepts the following options. Also see \*note Common
options::.

‘-c’ ‘--changes’ Verbosely describe the action for each FILE whose
ownership actually changes.

‘-f’ ‘--silent’ ‘--quiet’ Do not print error messages about files whose
ownership cannot be changed.

‘--from=OLD-OWNER’ Change a FILE’s ownership only if it has current
attributes specified by OLD-OWNER. OLD-OWNER has the same form as
NEW-OWNER described above. This option is useful primarily from a
security standpoint in that it narrows considerably the window of
potential abuse. For example, to reflect a user ID numbering change for
one user’s files without an option like this, ‘root’ might run

``` 
      find / -owner OLDUSER -print0 | xargs -0 chown -h NEWUSER

 But that is dangerous because the interval between when the ‘find’
 tests the existing file’s owner and when the ‘chown’ is actually
 run may be quite large.  One way to narrow the gap would be to
 invoke chown for each file as it is found:

      find / -owner OLDUSER -exec chown -h NEWUSER {} \;

 But that is very slow if there are many affected files.  With this
 option, it is safer (the gap is narrower still) though still not
 perfect:

      chown -h -R --from=OLDUSER NEWUSER /
```

‘--dereference’ Do not act on symbolic links themselves but rather on
what they point to. This is the default when not operating recursively.

``` 
 Combining this dereferencing option with the ‘--recursive’ option
 may create a security risk: During the traversal of the directory
 tree, an attacker may be able to introduce a symlink to an
 arbitrary target; when the tool reaches that, the operation will be
 performed on the target of that symlink, possibly allowing the
 attacker to escalate privileges.
```

‘-h’ ‘--no-dereference’ Act on symbolic links themselves instead of what
they point to. This mode relies on the ‘lchown’ system call. On systems
that do not provide the ‘lchown’ system call, ‘chown’ fails when a file
specified on the command line is a symbolic link. By default, no
diagnostic is issued for symbolic links encountered during a recursive
traversal, but see ‘--verbose’.

‘--preserve-root’ Fail upon any attempt to recursively change the root
directory, ‘/’. Without ‘--recursive’, this option has no effect. \*Note
Treating / specially::.

‘--no-preserve-root’ Cancel the effect of any preceding
‘--preserve-root’ option. \*Note Treating / specially::.

‘--reference=REF\_FILE’ Change the user and group of each FILE to be the
same as those of REF\_FILE. If REF\_FILE is a symbolic link, do not use
the user and group of the symbolic link, but rather those of the file it
refers to.

‘-v’ ‘--verbose’ Output a diagnostic for every file processed. If a
symbolic link is encountered during a recursive traversal on a system
without the ‘lchown’ system call, and ‘--no-dereference’ is in effect,
then issue a diagnostic saying neither the symbolic link nor its
referent is being changed.

‘-R’ ‘--recursive’ Recursively change ownership of directories and their
contents.

‘-H’ If ‘--recursive’ (‘-R’) is specified and a command line argument is
a symbolic link to a directory, traverse it. \*Note Traversing
symlinks::.

‘-L’ In a recursive traversal, traverse every symbolic link to a
directory that is encountered.

``` 
 Combining this dereferencing option with the ‘--recursive’ option
 may create a security risk: During the traversal of the directory
 tree, an attacker may be able to introduce a symlink to an
 arbitrary target; when the tool reaches that, the operation will be
 performed on the target of that symlink, possibly allowing the
 attacker to escalate privileges.

 *Note Traversing symlinks::.
```

‘-P’ Do not traverse any symbolic links. This is the default if none of
‘-H’, ‘-L’, or ‘-P’ is specified. \*Note Traversing symlinks::.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

Examples:

``` 
 # Change the owner of /u to "root".
 chown root /u

 # Likewise, but also change its group to "staff".
 chown root:staff /u

 # Change the owner of /u and subfiles to "root".
 chown -hR root /u
```
