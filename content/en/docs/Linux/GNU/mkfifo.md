# ‘mkfifo’: Make FIFOs (named pipes)

‘mkfifo’ creates FIFOs (also called “named pipes”) with the specified
names.
Synopsis:

``` 
 mkfifo [OPTION] NAME...
```

A “FIFO” is a special file type that permits independent processes to
communicate. One process opens the FIFO file for writing, and another
for reading, after which data can flow as with the usual anonymous pipe
in shells or elsewhere.

The program accepts the following options. Also see \*note Common
options::.

‘-m MODE’ ‘--mode=MODE’ Set the mode of created FIFOs to MODE, which is
symbolic as in ‘chmod’ and uses ‘a=rw’ (read and write allowed for
everyone) for the point of departure. MODE should specify only file
permission bits. \*Note File permissions::.

‘-Z’ ‘--context\[=CONTEXT\]’ Without a specified CONTEXT, adjust the
SELinux security context according to the system default type for
destination files, similarly to the ‘restorecon’ command. The long form
of this option with a specific context specified, will set the context
for newly created files only. With a specified context, if both SELinux
and SMACK are disabled, a warning is issued.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.
