# ‘tr’: Translate, squeeze, and/or delete characters

Synopsis:

``` 
 tr [OPTION]... SET1 [SET2]
```

‘tr’ copies standard input to standard output, performing one of the
following operations:

• translate, and optionally squeeze repeated characters in the result, •
squeeze repeated characters, • delete characters, • delete characters,
then squeeze repeated characters from the result.

The SET1 and (if given) SET2 arguments define ordered sets of
characters, referred to below as SET1 and SET2. These sets are the
characters of the input that ‘tr’ operates on. The ‘--complement’ (‘-c’,
‘-C’) option replaces SET1 with its complement (all of the characters
that are not in SET1).

Currently ‘tr’ fully supports only single-byte characters. Eventually it
will support multibyte characters; when it does, the ‘-C’ option will
cause it to complement the set of characters, whereas ‘-c’ will cause it
to complement the set of values. This distinction will matter only when
some values are not characters, and this is possible only in locales
using multibyte encodings when the input contains encoding errors.

The program accepts the ‘--help’ and ‘--version’ options. \*Note Common
options::. Options must precede operands.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

## Specifying sets of characters

The format of the SET1 and SET2 arguments resembles the format of
regular expressions; however, they are not regular expressions, only
lists of characters. Most characters simply represent themselves in
these strings, but the strings can contain the shorthands listed below,
for convenience. Some of them can be used only in SET1 or SET2, as noted
below.

Backslash escapes

``` 
 The following backslash escape sequences are recognized:

 ‘\a’
      Control-G.
 ‘\b’
      Control-H.
 ‘\f’
      Control-L.
 ‘\n’
      Control-J.
 ‘\r’
      Control-M.
 ‘\t’
      Control-I.
 ‘\v’
      Control-K.
 ‘\OOO’
      The 8-bit character with the value given by OOO, which is 1 to
      3 octal digits.  Note that ‘\400’ is interpreted as the
      two-byte sequence, ‘\040’ ‘0’.
 ‘\\’
      A backslash.

 While a backslash followed by a character not listed above is
 interpreted as that character, the backslash also effectively
 removes any special significance, so it is useful to escape ‘[’,
 ‘]’, ‘*’, and ‘-’.
```

Ranges

``` 
 The notation ‘M-N’ expands to all of the characters from M through
 N, in ascending order.  M should collate before N; if it doesn’t,
 an error results.  As an example, ‘0-9’ is the same as
 ‘0123456789’.

 GNU ‘tr’ does not support the System V syntax that uses square
 brackets to enclose ranges.  Translations specified in that format
 sometimes work as expected, since the brackets are often
 transliterated to themselves.  However, they should be avoided
 because they sometimes behave unexpectedly.  For example, ‘tr -d
 '[0-9]'’ deletes brackets as well as digits.

 Many historically common and even accepted uses of ranges are not
 portable.  For example, on EBCDIC hosts using the ‘A-Z’ range will
 not do what most would expect because ‘A’ through ‘Z’ are not
 contiguous as they are in ASCII.  If you can rely on a POSIX
 compliant version of ‘tr’, then the best way to work around this is
 to use character classes (see below).  Otherwise, it is most
 portable (and most ugly) to enumerate the members of the ranges.
```

Repeated characters

``` 
 The notation ‘[C*N]’ in SET2 expands to N copies of character C.
 Thus, ‘[y*6]’ is the same as ‘yyyyyy’.  The notation ‘[C*]’ in
 STRING2 expands to as many copies of C as are needed to make SET2
 as long as SET1.  If N begins with ‘0’, it is interpreted in octal,
 otherwise in decimal.
```

Character classes

``` 
 The notation ‘[:CLASS:]’ expands to all of the characters in the
 (predefined) class CLASS.  The characters expand in no particular
 order, except for the ‘upper’ and ‘lower’ classes, which expand in
 ascending order.  When the ‘--delete’ (‘-d’) and
 ‘--squeeze-repeats’ (‘-s’) options are both given, any character
 class can be used in SET2.  Otherwise, only the character classes
 ‘lower’ and ‘upper’ are accepted in SET2, and then only if the
 corresponding character class (‘upper’ and ‘lower’, respectively)
 is specified in the same relative position in SET1.  Doing this
 specifies case conversion.  The class names are given below; an
 error results when an invalid class name is given.

 ‘alnum’
      Letters and digits.
 ‘alpha’
      Letters.
 ‘blank’
      Horizontal whitespace.
 ‘cntrl’
      Control characters.
 ‘digit’
      Digits.
 ‘graph’
      Printable characters, not including space.
 ‘lower’
      Lowercase letters.
 ‘print’
      Printable characters, including space.
 ‘punct’
      Punctuation characters.
 ‘space’
      Horizontal or vertical whitespace.
 ‘upper’
      Uppercase letters.
 ‘xdigit’
      Hexadecimal digits.
```

Equivalence classes

``` 
 The syntax ‘[=C=]’ expands to all of the characters that are
 equivalent to C, in no particular order.  Equivalence classes are a
 relatively recent invention intended to support non-English
 alphabets.  But there seems to be no standard way to define them or
 determine their contents.  Therefore, they are not fully
 implemented in GNU ‘tr’; each character’s equivalence class
 consists only of that character, which is of no particular use.
```

## Translating

‘tr’ performs translation when SET1 and SET2 are both given and the
‘--delete’ (‘-d’) option is not given. ‘tr’ translates each character
of its input that is in SET1 to the corresponding character in SET2.
Characters not in SET1 are passed through unchanged. When a character
appears more than once in SET1 and the corresponding characters in SET2
are not all the same, only the final one is used. For example, these two
commands are equivalent:

``` 
 tr aaa xyz
 tr a z
```

A common use of ‘tr’ is to convert lowercase characters to uppercase.
This can be done in many ways. Here are three of them:

``` 
 tr abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
 tr a-z A-Z
 tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]'
```

But note that using ranges like ‘a-z’ above is not portable.

When ‘tr’ is performing translation, SET1 and SET2 typically have the
same length. If SET1 is shorter than SET2, the extra characters at the
end of SET2 are ignored.

On the other hand, making SET1 longer than SET2 is not portable; POSIX
says that the result is undefined. In this situation, BSD ‘tr’ pads SET2
to the length of SET1 by repeating the last character of SET2 as many
times as necessary. System V ‘tr’ truncates SET1 to the length of SET2.

By default, GNU ‘tr’ handles this case like BSD ‘tr’. When the
‘--truncate-set1’ (‘-t’) option is given, GNU ‘tr’ handles this case
like the System V ‘tr’ instead. This option is ignored for operations
other than translation.

Acting like System V ‘tr’ in this case breaks the relatively common BSD
idiom:

``` 
 tr -cs A-Za-z0-9 '\012'
```

because it converts only zero bytes (the first element in the complement
of SET1), rather than all non-alphanumerics, to newlines.

By the way, the above idiom is not portable because it uses ranges, and
it assumes that the octal code for newline is 012. Assuming a POSIX
compliant ‘tr’, here is a better way to write it:

``` 
 tr -cs '[:alnum:]' '[\n*]'
```

## Squeezing repeats and deleting

When given just the ‘--delete’ (‘-d’) option, ‘tr’ removes any input
characters that are in SET1.

When given just the ‘--squeeze-repeats’ (‘-s’) option and not
translating, ‘tr’ replaces each input sequence of a repeated character
that is in SET1 with a single occurrence of that character.

When given both ‘--delete’ and ‘--squeeze-repeats’, ‘tr’ first performs
any deletions using SET1, then squeezes repeats from any remaining
characters using SET2.

The ‘--squeeze-repeats’ option may also be used when translating, in
which case ‘tr’ first performs translation, then squeezes repeats from
any remaining characters using SET2.

Here are some examples to illustrate various combinations of options:

• Remove all zero bytes:

``` 
      tr -d '\0'
```

• Put all words on lines by themselves. This converts all
non-alphanumeric characters to newlines, then squeezes each string of
repeated newlines into a single newline:

``` 
      tr -cs '[:alnum:]' '[\n*]'
```

• Convert each sequence of repeated newlines to a single newline. I.e.,
delete blank lines:

``` 
      tr -s '\n'
```

• Find doubled occurrences of words in a document. For example, people
often write “the the” with the repeated words separated by a newline.
The Bourne shell script below works first by converting each sequence of
punctuation and blank characters to a single newline. That puts each
“word” on a line by itself. Next it maps all uppercase characters to
lower case, and finally it runs ‘uniq’ with the ‘-d’ option to print out
only the words that were repeated.

``` 
      #!/bin/sh
      cat -- "$@" \
        | tr -s '[:punct:][:blank:]' '[\n*]' \
        | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' \
        | uniq -d
```

• Deleting a small set of characters is usually straightforward. For
example, to remove all ‘a’s, ‘x’s, and ‘M’s you would do this:

``` 
      tr -d axM

 However, when ‘-’ is one of those characters, it can be tricky
 because ‘-’ has special meanings.  Performing the same task as
 above but also removing all ‘-’ characters, we might try ‘tr -d
 -axM’, but that would fail because ‘tr’ would try to interpret ‘-a’
 as a command-line option.  Alternatively, we could try putting the
 hyphen inside the string, ‘tr -d a-xM’, but that wouldn’t work
 either because it would make ‘tr’ interpret ‘a-x’ as the range of
 characters ‘a’...‘x’ rather than the three.  One way to solve the
 problem is to put the hyphen at the end of the list of characters:

      tr -d axM-

 Or you can use ‘--’ to terminate option processing:

      tr -d -- -axM

 More generally, use the character class notation ‘[=c=]’ with ‘-’
 (or any other character) in place of the ‘c’:

      tr -d '[=-=]axM'

 Note how single quotes are used in the above example to protect the
 square brackets from interpretation by a shell.
