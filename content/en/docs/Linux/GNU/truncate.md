# ‘truncate’: Shrink or extend the size of a file

‘truncate’ shrinks or extends the size of each FILE to the specified
size.
Synopsis:

```ash 
 truncate OPTION... FILE...
```

Any FILE that does not exist is created.

If a FILE is larger than the specified size, the extra data is lost. If
a FILE is shorter, it is extended and the extended part (or hole) reads
as zero bytes.

The program accepts the following options. Also see \*note Common
options::.

‘-c’ ‘--no-create’ Do not create files that do not exist.

‘-o’ ‘--io-blocks’ Treat SIZE as number of I/O blocks of the FILE rather
than bytes.

‘-r RFILE’ ‘--reference=RFILE’ Base the size of each FILE on the size of
RFILE.

‘-s SIZE’ ‘--size=SIZE’ Set or adjust the size of each FILE according to
SIZE. SIZE is in bytes unless ‘--io-blocks’ is specified. SIZE may be,
or may be an integer optionally followed by, one of the following
multiplicative suffixes: ‘KB’ =\> 1000 (KiloBytes) ‘K’ =\> 1024
(KibiBytes) ‘MB’ =\> 1000*1000 (MegaBytes) ‘M’ =\> 1024*1024 (MebiBytes)
‘GB’ =\> 1000*1000*1000 (GigaBytes) ‘G’ =\> 1024*1024*1024 (GibiBytes)
and so on for ‘T’, ‘P’, ‘E’, ‘Z’, and ‘Y’.

```ash 
 SIZE may also be prefixed by one of the following to adjust the
 size of each FILE based on its current size:
      ‘+’  => extend by
      ‘-’  => reduce by
      ‘<’  => at most
      ‘>’  => at least
      ‘/’  => round down to multiple of
      ‘%’  => round up to multiple of
```

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.
