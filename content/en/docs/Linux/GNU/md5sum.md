# ‘md5sum’: Print or check MD5 digests

‘md5sum’ computes a 128-bit checksum (or “fingerprint” or
“message-digest”) for each specified FILE.

Note: The MD5 digest is more reliable than a simple CRC (provided by the
‘cksum’ command) for detecting accidental file corruption, as the
chances of accidentally having two files with identical MD5 are
vanishingly small. However, it should not be considered secure against
malicious tampering: although finding a file with a given MD5
fingerprint is considered infeasible at the moment, it is known how to
modify certain files, including digital certificates, so that they
appear valid when signed with an MD5 digest. For more secure hashes,
consider using SHA-2, or the newer ‘b2sum’ command. \*Note sha2
utilities::. \*Note b2sum invocation::.

If a FILE is specified as ‘-’ or if no files are given ‘md5sum’ computes
the checksum for the standard input. ‘md5sum’ can also determine whether
a file and checksum are consistent.
Synopsis:

``` 
 md5sum [OPTION]... [FILE]...
```

For each FILE, ‘md5sum’ outputs by default, the MD5 checksum, a space, a
flag indicating binary or text input mode, and the file name. Binary
mode is indicated with ‘\*’, text mode with ‘ ’ (space). Binary mode is
the default on systems where it’s significant, otherwise text mode is
the default. Without ‘--zero’, if FILE contains a backslash or newline,
the line is started with a backslash, and each problematic character in
the file name is escaped with a backslash, making the output unambiguous
even in the presence of arbitrary file names. If FILE is omitted or
specified as ‘-’, standard input is read.

The program accepts the following options. Also see \*note Common
options::.

‘-b’ ‘--binary’ Treat each input file as binary, by reading it in binary
mode and outputting a ‘\*’ flag. This is the inverse of ‘--text’. On
systems like GNU that do not distinguish between binary and text files,
this option merely flags each input mode as binary: the MD5 checksum is
unaffected. This option is the default on systems like MS-DOS that
distinguish between binary and text files, except for reading standard
input when standard input is a terminal.

‘-c’ ‘--check’ Read file names and checksum information (not data) from
each FILE (or from stdin if no FILE was specified) and report whether
the checksums match the contents of the named files. The input to this
mode of ‘md5sum’ is usually the output of a prior, checksum-generating
run of ‘md5sum’. Three input formats are supported. Either the default
output format described above, the ‘--tag’ output format, or the BSD
reversed mode format which is similar to the default mode, but doesn’t
use a character to distinguish binary and text modes. Output with
‘--zero’ enabled is not supported by ‘--check’.

``` 
 For each such line, ‘md5sum’ reads the named file and computes its
 MD5 checksum.  Then, if the computed message digest does not match
 the one on the line with the file name, the file is noted as having
 failed the test.  Otherwise, the file passes the test.  By default,
 for each valid line, one line is written to standard output
 indicating whether the named file passed the test.  After all
 checks have been performed, if there were any failures, a warning
 is issued to standard error.  Use the ‘--status’ option to inhibit
 that output.  If any listed file cannot be opened or read, if any
 valid line has an MD5 checksum inconsistent with the associated
 file, or if no valid line is found, ‘md5sum’ exits with nonzero
 status.  Otherwise, it exits successfully.
```

‘--ignore-missing’ This option is useful only when verifying checksums.
When verifying checksums, don’t fail or report any status for missing
files. This is useful when verifying a subset of downloaded files given
a larger list of checksums.

‘--quiet’ This option is useful only when verifying checksums. When
verifying checksums, don’t generate an ’OK’ message per successfully
checked file. Files that fail the verification are reported in the
default one-line-per-file format. If there is any checksum mismatch,
print a warning summarizing the failures to standard error.

‘--status’ This option is useful only when verifying checksums. When
verifying checksums, don’t generate the default one-line-per-file
diagnostic and don’t output the warning summarizing any failures.
Failures to open or read a file still evoke individual diagnostics to
standard error. If all listed files are readable and are consistent with
the associated MD5 checksums, exit successfully. Otherwise exit with a
status code indicating there was a failure.

‘--tag’ Output BSD style checksums, which indicate the checksum
algorithm used. As a GNU extension, if ‘--zero’ is not used, file names
with problematic characters are escaped as described above, with the
same escaping indicator of ‘\\’ at the start of the line, being used.
The ‘--tag’ option implies binary mode, and is disallowed with ‘--text’
mode as supporting that would unnecessarily complicate the output
format, while providing little benefit.

‘-t’ ‘--text’ Treat each input file as text, by reading it in text mode
and outputting a ‘ ’ flag. This is the inverse of ‘--binary’. This
option is the default on systems like GNU that do not distinguish
between binary and text files. On other systems, it is the default for
reading standard input when standard input is a terminal. This mode is
never defaulted to if ‘--tag’ is used.

‘-w’ ‘--warn’ When verifying checksums, warn about improperly formatted
MD5 checksum lines. This option is useful only if all but a few lines in
the checked input are valid.

‘--strict’ When verifying checksums, if one or more input line is
invalid, exit nonzero after all warnings have been issued.

‘-z’ ‘--zero’ Output a zero byte (ASCII NUL) at the end of each line,
rather than a newline. This option enables other programs to parse the
output even when that output would contain data with embedded newlines.
Also file name escaping is not used.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.
