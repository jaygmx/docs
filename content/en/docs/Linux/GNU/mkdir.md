# ‘mkdir’: Make directories

‘mkdir’ creates directories with the specified names.
Synopsis:

``` 
 mkdir [OPTION]... NAME...
```

‘mkdir’ creates each directory NAME in the order given. It reports an
error if NAME already exists, unless the ‘-p’ option is given and NAME
is a directory.

The program accepts the following options. Also see \*note Common
options::.

‘-m MODE’ ‘--mode=MODE’ Set the file permission bits of created
directories to MODE, which uses the same syntax as in ‘chmod’ and uses
‘a=rwx’ (read, write and execute allowed for everyone) for the point
of the departure. \*Note File permissions::.

``` 
 Normally the directory has the desired file mode bits at the moment
 it is created.  As a GNU extension, MODE may also mention special
 mode bits, but in this case there may be a temporary window during
 which the directory exists but its special mode bits are incorrect.
 *Note Directory Setuid and Setgid::, for how the set-user-ID and
 set-group-ID bits of directories are inherited unless overridden in
 this way.
```

‘-p’ ‘--parents’ Make any missing parent directories for each argument,
setting their file permission bits to the umask modified by ‘u+wx’.
Ignore existing parent directories, and do not change their file
permission bits.

``` 
 To set the file permission bits of any newly-created parent
 directories to a value that includes ‘u+wx’, you can set the umask
 before invoking ‘mkdir’.  For example, if the shell command ‘(umask
 u=rwx,go=rx; mkdir -p P/Q)’ creates the parent ‘P’ it sets the
 parent’s permission bits to ‘u=rwx,go=rx’.  To set a parent’s
 special mode bits as well, you can invoke ‘chmod’ after ‘mkdir’.
 *Note Directory Setuid and Setgid::, for how the set-user-ID and
 set-group-ID bits of newly-created parent directories are
 inherited.
```

‘-v’ ‘--verbose’ Print a message for each created directory. This is
most useful with ‘--parents’.

‘-Z’ ‘--context\[=CONTEXT\]’ Without a specified CONTEXT, adjust the
SELinux security context according to the system default type for
destination files, similarly to the ‘restorecon’ command. The long form
of this option with a specific context specified, will set the context
for newly created files only. With a specified context, if both SELinux
and SMACK are disabled, a warning is issued.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.
