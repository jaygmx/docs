# ‘readlink’: Print value of a symlink or canonical file name

‘readlink’ may work in one of two supported modes:

‘Readlink mode’

``` 
 ‘readlink’ outputs the value of the given symbolic links.  If
 ‘readlink’ is invoked with an argument other than the name of a
 symbolic link, it produces no output and exits with a nonzero exit
 code.
```

‘Canonicalize mode’

``` 
 ‘readlink’ outputs the absolute name of the given files which
 contain no ‘.’, ‘..’ components nor any repeated separators (‘/’)
 or symbolic links.  Note the ‘realpath’ command is the preferred
 command to use for canonicalization.  *Note realpath invocation::.

 readlink [OPTION]... FILE...
```

By default, ‘readlink’ operates in readlink mode.

The program accepts the following options. Also see \*note Common
options::.

‘-f’ ‘--canonicalize’ Activate canonicalize mode. If any component of
the file name except the last one is missing or unavailable, ‘readlink’
produces no output and exits with a nonzero exit code. A trailing slash
is ignored.

‘-e’ ‘--canonicalize-existing’ Activate canonicalize mode. If any
component is missing or unavailable, ‘readlink’ produces no output and
exits with a nonzero exit code. A trailing slash requires that the name
resolve to a directory.

‘-m’ ‘--canonicalize-missing’ Activate canonicalize mode. If any
component is missing or unavailable, ‘readlink’ treats it as a
directory.

‘-n’ ‘--no-newline’ Do not print the output delimiter, when a single
FILE is specified. Print a warning if specified along with multiple
FILEs.

‘-s’ ‘-q’ ‘--silent’ ‘--quiet’ Suppress most error messages. On by
default.

‘-v’ ‘--verbose’ Report error messages.

‘-z’ ‘--zero’ Output a zero byte (ASCII NUL) at the end of each line,
rather than a newline. This option enables other programs to parse the
output even when that output would contain data with embedded newlines.

The ‘readlink’ utility first appeared in OpenBSD 2.1.

The ‘realpath’ command without options, operates like ‘readlink’ in
canonicalize mode.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.
