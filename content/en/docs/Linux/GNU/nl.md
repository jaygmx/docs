# ‘nl’: Number lines and write files

‘nl’ writes each FILE (‘-’ means standard input), or standard input if
none are given, to standard output, with line numbers added to some or
all of the lines.
Synopsis:

``` 
 nl [OPTION]... [FILE]...
```

‘nl’ decomposes its input into (logical) page sections; by default, the
line number is reset to 1 at each logical page section. ‘nl’ treats all
of the input files as a single document; it does not reset line numbers
or logical pages between files.

A logical page consists of three sections: header, body, and footer. Any
of the sections can be empty. Each can be numbered in a different style
from the others.

The beginnings of the sections of logical pages are indicated in the
input file by a line containing exactly one of these delimiter strings:

‘:::’ start of header; ‘::’ start of body; ‘:’ start of footer.

The two characters from which these strings are made can be changed from
‘\\’ and ‘:’ via options (see below), but the pattern and length of each
string cannot be changed.

A section delimiter is replaced by an empty line on output. Any text
that comes before the first section delimiter string in the input file
is considered to be part of a body section, so ‘nl’ treats a file that
contains no section delimiters as a single body section.

The program accepts the following options. Also see \*note Common
options::.

‘-b STYLE’ ‘--body-numbering=STYLE’ Select the numbering style for lines
in the body section of each logical page. When a line is not numbered,
the current line number is not incremented, but the line number
separator character is still prepended to the line. The styles are:

``` 
 ‘a’
      number all lines,
 ‘t’
      number only nonempty lines (default for body),
 ‘n’
      do not number lines (default for header and footer),
 ‘pBRE’
      number only lines that contain a match for the basic regular
      expression BRE.  *Note Regular Expressions: (grep)Regular
      Expressions.
```

‘-d CD’ ‘--section-delimiter=CD’ Set the section delimiter characters to
CD; default is ‘:’. If only C is given, the second remains ‘:’.
(Remember to protect ‘\\’ or other metacharacters from shell expansion
with quotes or extra backslashes.)

‘-f STYLE’ ‘--footer-numbering=STYLE’ Analogous to ‘--body-numbering’.

‘-h STYLE’ ‘--header-numbering=STYLE’ Analogous to ‘--body-numbering’.

‘-i NUMBER’ ‘--line-increment=NUMBER’ Increment line numbers by NUMBER
(default 1).

‘-l NUMBER’ ‘--join-blank-lines=NUMBER’ Consider NUMBER (default 1)
consecutive empty lines to be one logical line for numbering, and only
number the last one. Where fewer than NUMBER consecutive empty lines
occur, do not number them. An empty line is one that contains no
characters, not even spaces or tabs.

‘-n FORMAT’ ‘--number-format=FORMAT’ Select the line numbering format
(default is ‘rn’):

``` 
 ‘ln’
      left justified, no leading zeros;
 ‘rn’
      right justified, no leading zeros;
 ‘rz’
      right justified, leading zeros.
```

‘-p’ ‘--no-renumber’ Do not reset the line number at the start of a
logical page.

‘-s STRING’ ‘--number-separator=STRING’ Separate the line number from
the text line in the output with STRING (default is the TAB character).

‘-v NUMBER’ ‘--starting-line-number=NUMBER’ Set the initial line number
on each logical page to NUMBER (default 1).

‘-w NUMBER’ ‘--number-width=NUMBER’ Use NUMBER characters for line
numbers (default 6).

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.
