# ‘df’: Report file system disk space usage

‘df’ reports the amount of disk space used and available on file
systems.
Synopsis:

``` 
 df [OPTION]... [FILE]...
```

With no arguments, ‘df’ reports the space used and available on all
currently mounted file systems (of all types). Otherwise, ‘df’ reports
on the file system containing each argument FILE.

Normally the disk space is printed in units of 1024 bytes, but this can
be overridden (\*note Block size::). Non-integer quantities are rounded
up to the next higher unit.

For bind mounts and without arguments, ‘df’ only outputs the statistics
for that device with the shortest mount point name in the list of file
systems (MTAB), i.e., it hides duplicate entries, unless the ‘-a’ option
is specified.

With the same logic, ‘df’ elides a mount entry of a dummy pseudo device
if there is another mount entry of a real block device for that mount
point with the same device number, e.g. the early-boot pseudo file
system ‘rootfs’ is not shown per default when already the real root
device has been mounted.

If an argument FILE resolves to a special file containing a mounted file
system, ‘df’ shows the space available on that file system rather than
on the file system containing the device node. GNU ‘df’ does not attempt
to determine the disk usage on unmounted file systems, because on most
kinds of systems doing so requires extremely nonportable intimate
knowledge of file system structures.

The program accepts the following options. Also see \*note Common
options::.

‘-a’ ‘--all’ Include in the listing dummy, duplicate, or inaccessible
file systems, which are omitted by default. Dummy file systems are
typically special purpose pseudo file systems such as ‘/proc’, with no
associated storage. Duplicate file systems are local or remote file
systems that are mounted at separate locations in the local file
hierarchy, or bind mounted locations. Inaccessible file systems are
those which are mounted but subsequently over-mounted by another file
system at that point, or otherwise inaccessible due to permissions of
the mount point etc.

‘-B SIZE’ ‘--block-size=SIZE’ Scale sizes by SIZE before printing them
(\*note Block size::). For example, ‘-BG’ prints sizes in units of
1,073,741,824 bytes.

‘-h’ ‘--human-readable’ Append a size letter to each size, such as ‘M’
for mebibytes. Powers of 1024 are used, not 1000; ‘M’ stands for
1,048,576 bytes. This option is equivalent to
‘--block-size=human-readable’. Use the ‘--si’ option if you prefer
powers of 1000.

‘-H’ Equivalent to ‘--si’.

‘-i’ ‘--inodes’ List inode usage information instead of block usage. An
inode (short for index node) contains information about a file such as
its owner, permissions, timestamps, and location on the disk.

‘-k’ Print sizes in 1024-byte blocks, overriding the default block size
(\*note Block size::). This option is equivalent to ‘--block-size=1K’.

‘-l’ ‘--local’ Limit the listing to local file systems. By default,
remote file systems are also listed.

‘--no-sync’ Do not invoke the ‘sync’ system call before getting any
usage data. This may make ‘df’ run significantly faster on systems with
many disks, but on some systems (notably SunOS) the results may be
slightly out of date. This is the default.

‘--output’ ‘--output\[=FIELD\_LIST\]’ Use the output format defined by
FIELD\_LIST, or print all fields if FIELD\_LIST is omitted. In the
latter case, the order of the columns conforms to the order of the field
descriptions below.

``` 
 The use of the ‘--output’ together with each of the options ‘-i’,
 ‘-P’, and ‘-T’ is mutually exclusive.

 FIELD_LIST is a comma-separated list of columns to be included in
 ‘df’’s output and therefore effectively controls the order of
 output columns.  Each field can thus be used at the place of
 choice, but yet must only be used once.

 Valid field names in the FIELD_LIST are:
 ‘source’
      The source of the mount point, usually a device.
 ‘fstype’
      File system type.

 ‘itotal’
      Total number of inodes.
 ‘iused’
      Number of used inodes.
 ‘iavail’
      Number of available inodes.
 ‘ipcent’
      Percentage of IUSED divided by ITOTAL.

 ‘size’
      Total number of blocks.
 ‘used’
      Number of used blocks.
 ‘avail’
      Number of available blocks.
 ‘pcent’
      Percentage of USED divided by SIZE.

 ‘file’
      The file name if specified on the command line.
 ‘target’
      The mount point.

 The fields for block and inodes statistics are affected by the
 scaling options like ‘-h’ as usual.

 The definition of the FIELD_LIST can even be split among several
 ‘--output’ uses.

      #!/bin/sh
      # Print the TARGET (i.e., the mount point) along with their percentage
      # statistic regarding the blocks and the inodes.
      df --out=target --output=pcent,ipcent

      # Print all available fields.
      df --o
```

‘-P’ ‘--portability’ Use the POSIX output format. This is like the
default format except for the following:

``` 
   1. The information about each file system is always printed on
      exactly one line; a mount device is never put on a line by
      itself.  This means that if the mount device name is more than
      20 characters long (e.g., for some network mounts), the
      columns are misaligned.

   2. The labels in the header output line are changed to conform to
      POSIX.

   3. The default block size and output format are unaffected by the
      ‘DF_BLOCK_SIZE’, ‘BLOCK_SIZE’ and ‘BLOCKSIZE’ environment
      variables.  However, the default block size is still affected
      by ‘POSIXLY_CORRECT’: it is 512 if ‘POSIXLY_CORRECT’ is set,
      1024 otherwise.  *Note Block size::.
```

‘--si’ Append an SI-style abbreviation to each size, such as ‘M’ for
megabytes. Powers of 1000 are used, not 1024; ‘M’ stands for 1,000,000
bytes. This option is equivalent to ‘--block-size=si’. Use the ‘-h’ or
‘--human-readable’ option if you prefer powers of 1024.

‘--sync’ Invoke the ‘sync’ system call before getting any usage data. On
some systems (notably SunOS), doing this yields more up to date results,
but in general this option makes ‘df’ much slower, especially when there
are many or very busy file systems.

‘--total’ Print a grand total of all arguments after all arguments have
been processed. This can be used to find out the total disk size, usage
and available space of all listed devices. If no arguments are specified
df will try harder to elide file systems insignificant to the total
available space, by suppressing duplicate remote file systems.

``` 
 For the grand total line, ‘df’ prints ‘"total"’ into the SOURCE
 column, and ‘"-"’ into the TARGET column.  If there is no SOURCE
 column (see ‘--output’), then ‘df’ prints ‘"total"’ into the TARGET
 column, if present.
```

‘-t FSTYPE’ ‘--type=FSTYPE’ Limit the listing to file systems of type
FSTYPE. Multiple file system types can be specified by giving multiple
‘-t’ options. By default, nothing is omitted.

‘-T’ ‘--print-type’ Print each file system’s type. The types printed
here are the same ones you can include or exclude with ‘-t’ and ‘-x’.
The particular types printed are whatever is supported by the system.
Here are some of the common names (this list is certainly not
exhaustive):

``` 
 ‘nfs’
      An NFS file system, i.e., one mounted over a network from
      another machine.  This is the one type name which seems to be
      used uniformly by all systems.

 ‘ext2, ext3, ext4, xfs, btrfs...’
      A file system on a locally-mounted hard disk.  (The system
      might even support more than one type here; Linux does.)

 ‘iso9660, cdfs’
      A file system on a CD or DVD drive.  HP-UX uses ‘cdfs’, most
      other systems use ‘iso9660’.

 ‘ntfs,fat’
      File systems used by MS-Windows / MS-DOS.
```

‘-x FSTYPE’ ‘--exclude-type=FSTYPE’ Limit the listing to file systems
not of type FSTYPE. Multiple file system types can be eliminated by
giving multiple ‘-x’ options. By default, no file system types are
omitted.

‘-v’ Ignored; for compatibility with System V versions of ‘df’.

‘df’ is installed only on systems that have usable mount tables, so
portable scripts should not rely on its existence.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure. Failure includes the case where no output is generated, so you
can inspect the exit status of a command like ‘df -t ext3 -t reiserfs
DIR’ to test whether DIR is on a file system of type ‘ext3’ or
‘reiserfs’.

Since the list of file systems (MTAB) is needed to determine the file
system type, failure includes the cases when that list cannot be read
and one or more of the options ‘-a’, ‘-l’, ‘-t’ or ‘-x’ is used together
with a file name argument.
