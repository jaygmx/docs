# ‘dirname’: Strip last file name component

‘dirname’ prints all but the final slash-delimited component of each
NAME. Slashes on either side of the final component are also removed. If
the string contains no slash, ‘dirname’ prints ‘.’ (meaning the current
directory).
Synopsis:

``` 
 dirname [OPTION] NAME...
```

NAME need not be a file name, but if it is, this operation effectively
lists the directory that contains the final component, including the
case when the final component is itself a directory.

Together, ‘basename’ and ‘dirname’ are designed such that if ‘ls
"$name"’ succeeds, then the command sequence ‘cd "$(dirname "$name")";
ls "$(basename "$name")"’ will, too. This works for everything except
file names containing a trailing newline.

POSIX allows the implementation to define the results if NAME is ‘//’.
With GNU ‘dirname’, the result is ‘//’ on platforms where // is distinct
from /, and ‘/’ on platforms where there is no difference.

The program accepts the following option. Also see \*note Common
options::.

‘-z’ ‘--zero’ Output a zero byte (ASCII NUL) at the end of each line,
rather than a newline. This option enables other programs to parse the
output even when that output would contain data with embedded newlines.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

Examples:

``` 
 # Output "/usr/bin".
 dirname /usr/bin/sort
 dirname /usr/bin//.//

 # Output "dir1" followed by "dir2"
 dirname dir1/str dir2/str

 # Output ".".
 dirname stdio.h
```
