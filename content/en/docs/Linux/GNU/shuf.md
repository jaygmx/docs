# ‘shuf’: Shuffling text

‘shuf’ shuffles its input by outputting a random permutation of its
input lines. Each output permutation is equally likely. Synopses:

``` 
 shuf [OPTION]... [FILE]
 shuf -e [OPTION]... [ARG]...
 shuf -i LO-HI [OPTION]...
```

‘shuf’ has three modes of operation that affect where it obtains its
input lines. By default, it reads lines from standard input. The
following options change the operation mode:

‘-e’ ‘--echo’ Treat each command-line operand as an input line.

‘-i LO-HI’ ‘--input-range=LO-HI’ Act as if input came from a file
containing the range of unsigned decimal integers LO...HI, one per line.

‘shuf’’s other options can affect its behavior in all operation modes:

‘-n COUNT’ ‘--head-count=COUNT’ Output at most COUNT lines. By default,
all input lines are output.

‘-o OUTPUT-FILE’ ‘--output=OUTPUT-FILE’ Write output to OUTPUT-FILE
instead of standard output. ‘shuf’ reads all input before opening
OUTPUT-FILE, so you can safely shuffle a file in place by using commands
like ‘shuf -o F \<F’ and ‘cat F | shuf -o F’.

‘--random-source=FILE’ Use FILE as a source of random data used to
determine which permutation to generate. \*Note Random sources::.

‘-r’ ‘--repeat’ Repeat output values, that is, select with replacement.
With this option the output is not a permutation of the input; instead,
each output line is randomly chosen from all the inputs. This option is
typically combined with ‘--head-count’; if ‘--head-count’ is not given,
‘shuf’ repeats indefinitely.

‘-z’ ‘--zero-terminated’ Delimit items with a zero byte rather than a
newline (ASCII LF). I.e., treat input as items separated by ASCII NUL
and terminate output items with ASCII NUL. This option can be useful in
conjunction with ‘perl -0’ or ‘find -print0’ and ‘xargs -0’ which do the
same in order to reliably handle arbitrary file names (even those
containing blanks or other special characters).

For example:

``` 
 shuf <<EOF
 A man,
 a plan,
 a canal:
 Panama!
 EOF
```

might produce the output

``` 
 Panama!
 A man,
 a canal:
 a plan,
```

Similarly, the command:

``` 
 shuf -e clubs hearts diamonds spades
```

might output:

``` 
 clubs
 diamonds
 spades
 hearts
```

and the command ‘shuf -i 1-4’ might output:

``` 
 4
 2
 1
 3
```

The above examples all have four input lines, so ‘shuf’ might produce
any of the twenty-four possible permutations of the input. In general,
if there are N input lines, there are N\! (i.e., N factorial, or N \* (N

  - 1.    - ... \* 1) possible output permutations.

To output 50 random numbers each in the range 0 through 9, use:

``` 
 shuf -r -n 50 -i 0-9
```

To simulate 100 coin flips, use:

``` 
 shuf -r -n 100 -e Head Tail
```

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.
