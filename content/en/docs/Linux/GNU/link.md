# ‘link’: Make a hard link via the link syscall

‘link’ creates a single hard link at a time. It is a minimalist
interface to the system-provided ‘link’ function. \*Note (libc)Hard
Links::. It avoids the bells and whistles of the more commonly-used ‘ln’
command (\*note ln invocation::).
Synopsis:

``` 
 link FILENAME LINKNAME
```

FILENAME must specify an existing file, and LINKNAME must specify a
nonexistent entry in an existing directory. ‘link’ simply calls ‘link
(FILENAME, LINKNAME)’ to create the link.

On a GNU system, this command acts like ‘ln --directory
--no-target-directory FILENAME LINKNAME’. However, the ‘--directory’ and
‘--no-target-directory’ options are not specified by POSIX, and the
‘link’ command is more portable in practice.

If FILENAME is a symbolic link, it is unspecified whether LINKNAME will
be a hard link to the symbolic link or to the target of the symbolic
link. Use ‘ln -P’ or ‘ln -L’ to specify which behavior is desired.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.
