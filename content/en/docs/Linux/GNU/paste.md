# ‘paste’: Merge lines of files

‘paste’ writes to standard output lines consisting of sequentially
corresponding lines of each given file, separated by a TAB character.
Standard input is used for a file name of ‘-’ or if no input files are
given.

Synopsis:

``` 
 paste [OPTION]... [FILE]...
```

For example, with: $ cat num2 1 2 $ cat let3 a b c

Take lines sequentially from each file: $ paste num2 let3 1 a 2 b c

Duplicate lines from a file: $ paste num2 let3 num2 1 a 1 2 b 2 c

Intermix lines from stdin: $ paste - let3 - \< num2 1 a 2 b c

Join consecutive lines with a space: $ seq 4 | paste -d ' ' - - 1 2 3 4

The program accepts the following options. Also see \*note Common
options::.

‘-s’ ‘--serial’ Paste the lines of one file at a time rather than one
line from each file. Using the above example data:

``` 
      $ paste -s num2 let3
      1       2
      a       b       c
```

‘-d DELIM-LIST’ ‘--delimiters=DELIM-LIST’ Consecutively use the
characters in DELIM-LIST instead of TAB to separate merged lines. When
DELIM-LIST is exhausted, start again at its beginning. Using the above
example data:

``` 
      $ paste -d '%_' num2 let3 num2
      1%a_1
      2%b_2
      %c_
```

‘-z’ ‘--zero-terminated’ Delimit items with a zero byte rather than a
newline (ASCII LF). I.e., treat input as items separated by ASCII NUL
and terminate output items with ASCII NUL. This option can be useful in
conjunction with ‘perl -0’ or ‘find -print0’ and ‘xargs -0’ which do the
same in order to reliably handle arbitrary file names (even those
containing blanks or other special characters).

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.
