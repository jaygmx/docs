# ‘yes’: Print a string until interrupted

‘yes’ prints the command line arguments, separated by spaces and
followed by a newline, forever until it is killed. If no arguments are
given, it prints ‘y’ followed by a newline forever until killed.

Upon a write error, ‘yes’ exits with status ‘1’.

The only options are a lone ‘--help’ or ‘--version’. To output an
argument that begins with ‘-’, precede it with ‘--’, e.g., ‘yes --
--help’. \*Note Common options::.
