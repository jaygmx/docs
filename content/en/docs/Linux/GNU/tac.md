# ‘tac’: Concatenate and write files in reverse

‘tac’ copies each FILE (‘-’ means standard input), or standard input if
none are given, to standard output, reversing the records (lines by
default) in each separately.
Synopsis:

```bash 
 tac [OPTION]... [FILE]...
```

“Records” are separated by instances of a string (newline by default).
By default, this separator string is attached to the end of the record
that it follows in the file.

The program accepts the following options. Also see \*note Common
options::.

‘-b’ ‘--before’ The separator is attached to the beginning of the record
that it precedes in the file.

‘-r’ ‘--regex’ Treat the separator string as a regular expression.

‘-s SEPARATOR’ ‘--separator=SEPARATOR’ Use SEPARATOR as the record
separator, instead of newline. Note an empty SEPARATOR is treated as a
zero byte. I.e., input and output items are delimited with ASCII NUL.

On systems like MS-DOS that distinguish between text and binary files,
‘tac’ reads and writes in binary mode.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.

Example:

```bash 
 # Reverse a file character by character.
 tac -r -s 'x\|[^x]'
```
