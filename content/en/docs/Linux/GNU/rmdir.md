# ‘rmdir’: Remove empty directories

‘rmdir’ removes empty directories.
Synopsis:

``` 
 rmdir [OPTION]... DIRECTORY...
```

If any DIRECTORY argument does not refer to an existing empty directory,
it is an error.

The program accepts the following options. Also see \*note Common
options::.

‘--ignore-fail-on-non-empty’ Ignore each failure to remove a directory
that is solely because the directory is non-empty.

‘-p’ ‘--parents’ Remove DIRECTORY, then try to remove each component of
DIRECTORY. So, for example, ‘rmdir -p a/b/c’ is similar to ‘rmdir a/b/c
a/b a’. As such, it fails if any of those directories turns out not to
be empty. Use the ‘--ignore-fail-on-non-empty’ option to make it so such
a failure does not evoke a diagnostic and does not cause ‘rmdir’ to exit
unsuccessfully.

‘-v’ ‘--verbose’ Give a diagnostic for each successful removal.
DIRECTORY is removed.

\*Note rm invocation::, for how to remove non-empty directories
(recursively).

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.
