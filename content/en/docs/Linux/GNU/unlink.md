# ‘unlink’: Remove files via the unlink syscall

‘unlink’ deletes a single specified file name. It is a minimalist
interface to the system-provided ‘unlink’ function. \*Note
(libc)Deleting Files::.
Synopsis: It avoids the bells and whistles of
the more commonly-used ‘rm’ command (\*note rm invocation::).

``` 
 unlink FILENAME
```

On some systems ‘unlink’ can be used to delete the name of a directory.
On others, it can be used that way only by a privileged user. In the GNU
system ‘unlink’ can never delete the name of a directory.

The ‘unlink’ command honors the ‘--help’ and ‘--version’ options. To
remove a file whose name begins with ‘-’, prefix the name with ‘./’,
e.g., ‘unlink ./--help’.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.
