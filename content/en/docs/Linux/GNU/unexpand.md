# ‘unexpand’: Convert spaces to tabs

‘unexpand’ writes the contents of each given FILE, or standard input if
none are given or for a FILE of ‘-’, to standard output, converting
blanks at the beginning of each line into as many tab characters as
needed. In the default POSIX locale, a “blank” is a space or a tab;
other locales may specify additional blank characters.
Synopsis:

``` 
 unexpand [OPTION]... [FILE]...
```

By default, ‘unexpand’ converts only initial blanks (those that precede
all non-blank characters) on each line. It preserves backspace
characters in the output; they decrement the column count for tab
calculations. By default, tabs are set at every 8th column.

The program accepts the following options. Also see \*note Common
options::.

‘-t TAB1\[,TAB2\]...’ ‘--tabs=TAB1\[,TAB2\]...’ If only one tab stop is
given, set the tabs TAB1 columns apart instead of the default 8.
Otherwise, set the tabs at columns TAB1, TAB2, ... (numbered from 0),
and leave blanks beyond the tab stops given unchanged. Tab stops can be
separated by blanks as well as by commas.

``` 
 As a GNU extension the last TAB specified can be prefixed with a
 ‘/’ to indicate a tab size to use for remaining positions.  For
 example, ‘--tabs=2,4,/8’ will set tab stops at position 2 and 4,
 and every multiple of 8 after that.

 Also the last TAB specified can be prefixed with a ‘+’ to indicate
 a tab size to use for remaining positions, offset from the final
 explicitly specified tab stop.  For example, to ignore the 1
 character gutter present in diff output, one can specify a 1
 character offset using ‘--tabs=1,+8’, which will set tab stops at
 positions 1,9,17,...

 This option implies the ‘-a’ option.

 For compatibility, GNU ‘unexpand’ supports the obsolete option
 syntax, ‘-TAB1[,TAB2]...’, where tab stops must be separated by
 commas.  (Unlike ‘-t’, this obsolete option does not imply ‘-a’.)
 New scripts should use ‘--first-only -t TAB1[,TAB2]...’ instead.
```

‘-a’ ‘--all’ Also convert all sequences of two or more blanks just
before a tab stop, even if they occur after non-blank characters in a
line.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.
