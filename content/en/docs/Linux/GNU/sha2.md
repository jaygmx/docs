# sha2 utilities: Print or check SHA-2 digests

The commands ‘sha224sum’, ‘sha256sum’, ‘sha384sum’ and ‘sha512sum’
compute checksums of various lengths (respectively 224, 256, 384 and 512
bits), collectively known as the SHA-2 hashes. The usage and options of
these commands are precisely the same as for ‘md5sum’ and ‘sha1sum’.
\*Note md5sum invocation::.
