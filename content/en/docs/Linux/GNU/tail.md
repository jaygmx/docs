# ‘tail’: Output the last part of files

‘tail’ prints the last part (10 lines by default) of each FILE; it reads
from standard input if no files are given or when given a FILE of ‘-’.
Synopsis:

```bash
 tail [OPTION]... [FILE]...
```

If more than one FILE is specified, ‘tail’ prints a one-line header
before the output for each FILE, consisting of:

{{< highlight shell >}}
 ==> FILE NAME <==
{{< / highlight >}}

For further processing of tail output, it can be useful to convert the
file headers to line prefixes, which can be done like:
```bash
 tail ... |
 awk '
   /^==> .* <==$/ {prefix=substr($0,5,length-8)":"; next}
   {print prefix$0}
 ' | ...

```

GNU ‘tail’ can output any amount of data (some other versions of ‘tail’
cannot). It also has no ‘-r’ option (print in reverse), since reversing
a file is really a different job from printing the end of a file; BSD
‘tail’ (which is the one with ‘-r’) can only reverse files that are at
most as large as its buffer, which is typically 32 KiB. A more reliable
and versatile way to reverse files is the GNU ‘tac’ command.

The program accepts the following options. Also see \*note Common
options::.

‘-c \[+\]NUM’ ‘--bytes=\[+\]NUM’ Output the last NUM bytes, instead of
final lines. However, if NUM is prefixed with a ‘+’, start printing with
byte NUM from the start of each file, instead of from the end. NUM may
be, or may be an integer optionally followed by, one of the following
multiplicative suffixes: ‘b’ =\> 512 ("blocks") ‘KB’ =\> 1000
(KiloBytes) ‘K’ =\> 1024 (KibiBytes) ‘MB’ =\> 1000*1000 (MegaBytes) ‘M’
=\> 1024*1024 (MebiBytes) ‘GB’ =\> 1000*1000*1000 (GigaBytes) ‘G’ =\>
1024*1024*1024 (GibiBytes) and so on for ‘T’, ‘P’, ‘E’, ‘Z’, and ‘Y’.

‘-f’ ‘--follow\[=HOW\]’ Loop forever trying to read more characters at
the end of the file, presumably because the file is growing. If more
than one file is given, ‘tail’ prints a header whenever it gets output
from a different file, to indicate which file that output is from.


 There are two ways to specify how you’d like to track files with
 this option, but that difference is noticeable only when a followed
 file is removed or renamed.  If you’d like to continue to track the
 end of a growing file even after it has been unlinked, use
 ‘--follow=descriptor’.  This is the default behavior, but it is not
 useful if you’re tracking a log file that may be rotated (removed
 or renamed, then reopened).  In that case, use ‘--follow=name’ to
 track the named file, perhaps by reopening it periodically to see
 if it has been removed and recreated by some other program.  Note
 that the inotify-based implementation handles this case without the
 need for any periodic reopening.

 No matter which method you use, if the tracked file is determined
 to have shrunk, ‘tail’ prints a message saying the file has been
 truncated and resumes tracking the end of the file from the
 newly-determined endpoint.

 When a file is removed, ‘tail’’s behavior depends on whether it is
 following the name or the descriptor.  When following by name, tail
 can detect that a file has been removed and gives a message to that
 effect, and if ‘--retry’ has been specified it will continue
 checking periodically to see if the file reappears.  When following
 a descriptor, tail does not detect that the file has been unlinked
 or renamed and issues no message; even though the file may no
 longer be accessible via its original name, it may still be
 growing.

 The option values ‘descriptor’ and ‘name’ may be specified only
 with the long form of the option, not with ‘-f’.

 The ‘-f’ option is ignored if no FILE operand is specified and
 standard input is a FIFO or a pipe.  Likewise, the ‘-f’ option has
 no effect for any operand specified as ‘-’, when standard input is
 a FIFO or a pipe.

 With kernel inotify support, output is triggered by file changes
 and is generally very prompt.  Otherwise, ‘tail’ sleeps for one
 second between checks— use ‘--sleep-interval=N’ to change that
 default—which can make the output appear slightly less responsive
 or bursty.  When using tail without inotify support, you can make
 it more responsive by using a sub-second sleep interval, e.g., via
 an alias like this:
```bash
      alias tail='tail -s.1'
```

‘-F’ This option is the same as ‘--follow=name --retry’. That is, tail
will attempt to reopen a file when it is removed. Should this fail, tail
will keep trying until it becomes accessible again.

‘--max-unchanged-stats=N’ When tailing a file by name, if there have
been N (default n=5) consecutive iterations for which the file has not
changed, then ‘open’/‘fstat’ the file to determine if that file name is
still associated with the same device/inode-number pair as before. When
following a log file that is rotated, this is approximately the number
of seconds between when tail prints the last pre-rotation lines and when
it prints the lines that have accumulated in the new log file. This
option is meaningful only when polling (i.e., without inotify) and when
following by name.

‘-n \[+\]NUM’ ‘--lines=\[+\]’ Output the last NUM lines. However, if NUM
is prefixed with a ‘+’, start printing with line NUM from the start of
each file, instead of from the end. Size multiplier suffixes are the
same as with the ‘-c’ option.

‘--pid=PID’ When following by name or by descriptor, you may specify the
process ID, PID, of the sole writer of all FILE arguments. Then, shortly
after that process terminates, tail will also terminate. This will work
properly only if the writer and the tailing process are running on the
same machine. For example, to save the output of a build in a file and
to watch the file grow, if you invoke ‘make’ and ‘tail’ like this then
the tail process will stop when your build completes. Without this
option, you would have had to kill the ‘tail -f’ process yourself.

```bash
      $ make >& makerr & tail --pid=$! -f makerr

 If you specify a PID that is not in use or that does not correspond
 to the process that is writing to the tailed files, then ‘tail’ may
 terminate long before any FILEs stop growing or it may not
 terminate until long after the real writer has terminated.  Note
 that ‘--pid’ cannot be supported on some systems; ‘tail’ will print
 a warning if this is the case.
```

‘-q’ ‘--quiet’ ‘--silent’ Never print file name headers.

‘--retry’ Indefinitely try to open the specified file. This option is
useful mainly when following (and otherwise issues a warning).

``` 
 When following by file descriptor (i.e., with
 ‘--follow=descriptor’), this option only affects the initial open
 of the file, as after a successful open, ‘tail’ will start
 following the file descriptor.

 When following by name (i.e., with ‘--follow=name’), ‘tail’
 infinitely retries to re-open the given files until killed.

 Without this option, when ‘tail’ encounters a file that doesn’t
 exist or is otherwise inaccessible, it reports that fact and never
 checks it again.
```

‘-s NUMBER’ ‘--sleep-interval=NUMBER’ Change the number of seconds to
wait between iterations (the default is 1.0). During one iteration,
every specified file is checked to see if it has changed size.
Historical implementations of ‘tail’ have required that NUMBER be an
integer. However, GNU ‘tail’ accepts an arbitrary floating point number.
\*Note Floating point::. When ‘tail’ uses inotify, this polling-related
option is usually ignored. However, if you also specify ‘--pid=P’,
‘tail’ checks whether process P is alive at least every NUMBER
seconds.

‘-v’ ‘--verbose’ Always print file name headers.

‘-z’ ‘--zero-terminated’ Delimit items with a zero byte rather than a
newline (ASCII LF). I.e., treat input as items separated by ASCII NUL
and terminate output items with ASCII NUL. This option can be useful in
conjunction with ‘perl -0’ or ‘find -print0’ and ‘xargs -0’ which do the
same in order to reliably handle arbitrary file names (even those
containing blanks or other special characters).

For compatibility ‘tail’ also supports an obsolete usage ‘tail
-\[NUM\]\[bcl\]\[f\] \[FILE\]’, which is recognized only if it does not
conflict with the usage described above. This obsolete form uses exactly
one option and at most one file. In the option, NUM is an optional
decimal number optionally followed by a size letter (‘b’, ‘c’, ‘l’) to
mean count by 512-byte blocks, bytes, or lines, optionally followed by
‘f’ which has the same meaning as ‘-f’.

On systems not conforming to POSIX 1003.1-2001, the leading ‘-’ can be
replaced by ‘+’ in the traditional option syntax with the same meaning
as in counts, and on obsolete systems predating POSIX 1003.1-2001
traditional usage overrides normal usage when the two conflict. This
behavior can be controlled with the ‘\_POSIX2\_VERSION’ environment
variable (\*note Standards conformance::).

Scripts intended for use on standard hosts should avoid traditional
syntax and should use ‘-c NUM\[b\]’, ‘-n NUM’, and/or ‘-f’ instead. If
your script must also run on hosts that support only the traditional
syntax, you can often rewrite it to avoid problematic usages, e.g., by
using ‘sed -n '$p'’ rather than ‘tail -1’. If that’s not possible, the
script can use a test like ‘if tail -c +1 \</dev/null \>/dev/null 2\>&1;
then ...’ to decide which syntax to use.

Even if your script assumes the standard behavior, you should still
beware usages whose behaviors differ depending on the POSIX version. For
example, avoid ‘tail - main.c’, since it might be interpreted as either
‘tail main.c’ or as ‘tail -- - main.c’; avoid ‘tail -c 4’, since it
might mean either ‘tail -c4’ or ‘tail -c 10 4’; and avoid ‘tail +4’,
since it might mean either ‘tail ./+4’ or ‘tail -n +4’.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.
