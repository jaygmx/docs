# ‘cksum’: Print CRC checksum and byte counts

‘cksum’ computes a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) checksum for each given
FILE, or standard input if none are given or for a FILE of ‘-’.
Synopsis:

``` 
 cksum [OPTION]... [FILE]...
```

‘cksum’ prints the CRC checksum for each file along with the number of
bytes in the file, and the file name unless no arguments were given.

‘cksum’ is typically used to ensure that files transferred by unreliable
means (e.g., netnews) have not been corrupted, by comparing the ‘cksum’
output for the received files with the ‘cksum’ output for the original
files (typically given in the distribution).

The CRC algorithm is specified by the POSIX standard. It is not
compatible with the BSD or System V ‘sum’ algorithms (see the previous
section); it is more robust.

The only options are ‘--help’ and ‘--version’. \*Note Common options::.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.
