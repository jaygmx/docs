2 Common options

-----

Certain options are available in all of these programs. Rather than
writing identical descriptions for each of the programs, they are
described here. (In fact, every GNU program accepts (or should accept)
these options.)

Normally options and operands can appear in any order, and programs act
as if all the options appear before any operands. For example, ‘sort -r
passwd -t :’ acts like ‘sort -r -t : passwd’, since ‘:’ is an
option-argument of ‘-t’. However, if the ‘POSIXLY\_CORRECT’ environment
variable is set, options must appear before operands, unless otherwise
specified for a particular command.

A few programs can usefully have trailing operands with leading ‘-’.
With such a program, options must precede operands even if
‘POSIXLY\_CORRECT’ is not set, and this fact is noted in the program
description. For example, the ‘env’ command’s options must appear before
its operands, since in some cases the operands specify a command that
itself contains options.

Most programs that accept long options recognize unambiguous
abbreviations of those options. For example, ‘rmdir
--ignore-fail-on-non-empty’ can be invoked as ‘rmdir --ignore-fail’ or
even ‘rmdir --i’. Ambiguous options, such as ‘ls --h’, are identified as
such.

Some of these programs recognize the ‘--help’ and ‘--version’ options
only when one of them is the sole command line argument. For these
programs, abbreviations of the long options are not always recognized.

‘--help’ Print a usage message listing all available options, then exit
successfully.

‘--version’ Print the version number, then exit successfully.

‘--’ Delimit the option list. Later arguments, if any, are treated as
operands even if they begin with ‘-’. For example, ‘sort -- -r’ reads
from the file named ‘-r’.

A single ‘-’ operand is not really an option, though it looks like one.
It stands for a file operand, and some tools treat it as standard input,
or as standard output if that is clear from the context. For example,
‘sort -’ reads from standard input, and is equivalent to plain ‘sort’.
Unless otherwise specified, a ‘-’ can appear as any operand that
requires a file name.

# Exit status

Nearly every command invocation yields an integral “exit status” that
can be used to change how other commands work. For the vast majority of
commands, an exit status of zero indicates success. Failure is indicated
by a nonzero value—typically ‘1’, though it may differ on unusual
platforms as POSIX requires only that it be nonzero.

However, some of the programs documented here do produce other exit
status values and a few associate different meanings with the values ‘0’
and ‘1’. Here are some of the exceptions: ‘chroot’, ‘env’, ‘expr’,
‘nice’, ‘nohup’, ‘numfmt’, ‘printenv’, ‘sort’, ‘stdbuf’, ‘test’,
‘timeout’, ‘tty’.

# Backup options

Some GNU programs (at least ‘cp’, ‘install’, ‘ln’, and ‘mv’) optionally
make backups of files before writing new versions. These options control
the details of these backups. The options are also briefly mentioned in
the descriptions of the particular programs.

‘-b’ ‘--backup\[=METHOD\]’ Make a backup of each file that would
otherwise be overwritten or removed. Without this option, the original
versions are destroyed. Use METHOD to determine the type of backups to
make. When this option is used but METHOD is not specified, then the
value of the ‘VERSION\_CONTROL’ environment variable is used. And if
‘VERSION\_CONTROL’ is not set, the default backup type is ‘existing’.

``` 
 Note that the short form of this option, ‘-b’ does not accept any
 argument.  Using ‘-b’ is equivalent to using ‘--backup=existing’.

 This option corresponds to the Emacs variable ‘version-control’;
 the values for METHOD are the same as those used in Emacs.  This
 option also accepts more descriptive names.  The valid METHODs are
 (unique abbreviations are accepted):

 ‘none’
 ‘off’
      Never make backups.

 ‘numbered’
 ‘t’
      Always make numbered backups.

 ‘existing’
 ‘nil’
      Make numbered backups of files that already have them, simple
      backups of the others.

 ‘simple’
 ‘never’
      Always make simple backups.  Please note ‘never’ is not to be
      confused with ‘none’.
```

‘-S SUFFIX’ ‘--suffix=SUFFIX’ Append SUFFIX to each backup file made
with ‘-b’. If this option is not specified, the value of the
‘SIMPLE\_BACKUP\_SUFFIX’ environment variable is used. And if
‘SIMPLE\_BACKUP\_SUFFIX’ is not set, the default is ‘\~’, just as in
Emacs.

# Block size

Some GNU programs (at least ‘df’, ‘du’, and ‘ls’) display sizes in
“blocks”. You can adjust the block size and method of display to make
sizes easier to read. The block size used for display is independent of
any file system block size. Fractional block counts are rounded up to
the nearest integer.

The default block size is chosen by examining the following environment
variables in turn; the first one that is set determines the block size.

‘DF\_BLOCK\_SIZE’ This specifies the default block size for the ‘df’
command. Similarly, ‘DU\_BLOCK\_SIZE’ specifies the default for ‘du’ and
‘LS\_BLOCK\_SIZE’ for ‘ls’.

‘BLOCK\_SIZE’ This specifies the default block size for all three
commands, if the above command-specific environment variables are not
set.

‘BLOCKSIZE’ This specifies the default block size for all values that
are normally printed as blocks, if neither ‘BLOCK\_SIZE’ nor the above
command-specific environment variables are set. Unlike the other
environment variables, ‘BLOCKSIZE’ does not affect values that are
normally printed as byte counts, e.g., the file sizes contained in ‘ls
-l’ output.

‘POSIXLY\_CORRECT’ If neither ‘COMMAND\_BLOCK\_SIZE’, nor ‘BLOCK\_SIZE’,
nor ‘BLOCKSIZE’ is set, but this variable is set, the block size
defaults to 512.

If none of the above environment variables are set, the block size
currently defaults to 1024 bytes in most contexts, but this number may
change in the future. For ‘ls’ file sizes, the block size defaults to 1
byte.

A block size specification can be a positive integer specifying the
number of bytes per block, or it can be ‘human-readable’ or ‘si’ to
select a human-readable format. Integers may be followed by suffixes
that are upward compatible with the SI prefixes
(http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/chapter3.html) for
decimal multiples and with the ISO/IEC 80000-13 (formerly IEC 60027-2)
prefixes (https://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html) for binary
multiples.

With human-readable formats, output sizes are followed by a size letter
such as ‘M’ for megabytes. ‘BLOCK\_SIZE=human-readable’ uses powers of
1024; ‘M’ stands for 1,048,576 bytes. ‘BLOCK\_SIZE=si’ is similar, but
uses powers of 1000 and appends ‘B’; ‘MB’ stands for 1,000,000 bytes.

A block size specification preceded by ‘'’ causes output sizes to be
displayed with thousands separators. The ‘LC\_NUMERIC’ locale specifies
the thousands separator and grouping. For example, in an American
English locale, ‘--block-size="'1kB"’ would cause a size of 1234000
bytes to be displayed as ‘1,234’. In the default C locale, there is no
thousands separator so a leading ‘'’ has no effect.

An integer block size can be followed by a suffix to specify a multiple
of that size. A bare size letter, or one followed by ‘iB’, specifies a
multiple using powers of 1024. A size letter followed by ‘B’ specifies
powers of 1000 instead. For example, ‘1M’ and ‘1MiB’ are equivalent to
‘1048576’, whereas ‘1MB’ is equivalent to ‘1000000’.

A plain suffix without a preceding integer acts as if ‘1’ were
prepended, except that it causes a size indication to be appended to the
output. For example, ‘--block-size="kB"’ displays 3000 as ‘3kB’.

The following suffixes are defined. Large sizes like ‘1Y’ may be
rejected by your computer due to limitations of its arithmetic.

‘kB’ kilobyte: 10^3 = 1000. ‘k’ ‘K’ ‘KiB’ kibibyte: 2^{10} = 1024. ‘K’
is special: the SI prefix is ‘k’ and the ISO/IEC 80000-13 prefix is
‘Ki’, but tradition and POSIX use ‘k’ to mean ‘KiB’. ‘MB’ megabyte:
10^6 = 1,000,000. ‘M’ ‘MiB’ mebibyte: 2^{20} = 1,048,576. ‘GB’ gigabyte:
10^9 = 1,000,000,000. ‘G’ ‘GiB’ gibibyte: 2^{30} = 1,073,741,824. ‘TB’
terabyte: 10^{12} = 1,000,000,000,000. ‘T’ ‘TiB’ tebibyte: 2^{40} =
1,099,511,627,776. ‘PB’ petabyte: 10^{15} = 1,000,000,000,000,000. ‘P’
‘PiB’ pebibyte: 2^{50} = 1,125,899,906,842,624. ‘EB’ exabyte: 10^{18}
= 1,000,000,000,000,000,000. ‘E’ ‘EiB’ exbibyte: 2^{60} =
1,152,921,504,606,846,976. ‘ZB’ zettabyte: 10^{21} =
1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 ‘Z’ ‘ZiB’ 2^{70} =
1,180,591,620,717,411,303,424. ‘YB’ yottabyte: 10^{24} =
1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. ‘Y’ ‘YiB’ 2^{80} =
1,208,925,819,614,629,174,706,176.

Block size defaults can be overridden by an explicit ‘--block-size=SIZE’
option. The ‘-k’ option is equivalent to ‘--block-size=1K’, which is the
default unless the ‘POSIXLY\_CORRECT’ environment variable is set. The
‘-h’ or ‘--human-readable’ option is equivalent to
‘--block-size=human-readable’. The ‘--si’ option is equivalent to
‘--block-size=si’. Note for ‘ls’ the ‘-k’ option does not control the
display of the apparent file sizes, whereas the ‘--block-size’ option
does.

# Floating point numbers

Commands that accept or produce floating point numbers employ the
floating point representation of the underlying system, and suffer from
rounding error, overflow, and similar floating-point issues. Almost all
modern systems use IEEE-754 floating point, and it is typically portable
to assume IEEE-754 behavior these days. IEEE-754 has positive and
negative infinity, distinguishes positive from negative zero, and uses
special values called NaNs to represent invalid computations such as
dividing zero by itself. For more information, please see David
Goldberg’s paper What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About
Floating-Point Arithmetic (http://www.validlab.com/goldberg/paper.pdf).

Commands that accept floating point numbers as options, operands or
input use the standard C functions ‘strtod’ and ‘strtold’ to convert
from text to floating point numbers. These floating point numbers
therefore can use scientific notation like ‘1.0e-34’ and ‘-10e100’.
Commands that parse floating point also understand case-insensitive
‘inf’, ‘infinity’, and ‘NaN’, although whether such values are
useful depends on the command in question. Modern C implementations also
accept hexadecimal floating point numbers such as ‘-0x.ep-3’, which
stands for −14/16 times 2^-3, which equals −0.109375. The ‘LC\_NUMERIC’
locale determines the decimal-point character. \*Note (libc)Parsing of

# Signal specifications

A SIGNAL may be a signal name like ‘HUP’, or a signal number like ‘1’,
or an exit status of a process terminated by the signal. A signal name
can be given in canonical form or prefixed by ‘SIG’. The case of the
letters is ignored. The following signal names and numbers are supported
on all POSIX compliant systems:

‘HUP’ 1. Hangup. ‘INT’ 2. Terminal interrupt. ‘QUIT’ 3. Terminal quit.
‘ABRT’ 6. Process abort. ‘KILL’ 9. Kill (cannot be caught or ignored).
‘ALRM’ 14. Alarm Clock. ‘TERM’ 15. Termination.

Other supported signal names have system-dependent corresponding
numbers. All systems conforming to POSIX 1003.1-2001 also support the
following signals:

‘BUS’ Access to an undefined portion of a memory object. ‘CHLD’ Child
process terminated, stopped, or continued. ‘CONT’ Continue executing, if
stopped. ‘FPE’ Erroneous arithmetic operation. ‘ILL’ Illegal
Instruction. ‘PIPE’ Write on a pipe with no one to read it. ‘SEGV’
Invalid memory reference. ‘STOP’ Stop executing (cannot be caught or
ignored). ‘TSTP’ Terminal stop. ‘TTIN’ Background process attempting
read. ‘TTOU’ Background process attempting write. ‘URG’ High bandwidth
data is available at a socket. ‘USR1’ User-defined signal 1. ‘USR2’
User-defined signal 2.

POSIX 1003.1-2001 systems that support the XSI extension also support
the following signals:

‘POLL’ Pollable event. ‘PROF’ Profiling timer expired. ‘SYS’ Bad system
call. ‘TRAP’ Trace/breakpoint trap. ‘VTALRM’ Virtual timer expired.
‘XCPU’ CPU time limit exceeded. ‘XFSZ’ File size limit exceeded.

POSIX 1003.1-2001 systems that support the XRT extension also support at
least eight real-time signals called ‘RTMIN’, ‘RTMIN+1’, ..., ‘RTMAX-1’,
‘RTMAX’.

# chown, chgrp, chroot, id: Disambiguating user names and IDs

Since the USER and GROUP arguments to these commands may be specified as
names or numeric IDs, there is an apparent ambiguity. What if a user or
group *name* is a string of digits? (1) Should the command interpret it
as a user name or as an ID? POSIX requires that these commands first
attempt to resolve the specified string as a name, and only once that
fails, then try to interpret it as an ID. This is troublesome when you
want to specify a numeric ID, say 42, and it must work even in a
pathological situation where ‘42’ is a user name that maps to some other
user ID, say 1000. Simply invoking ‘chown 42 F’, will set ‘F’s owner ID
to 1000—not what you intended.

GNU ‘chown’, ‘chgrp’, ‘chroot’, and ‘id’ provide a way to work around
this, that at the same time may result in a significant performance
improvement by eliminating a database look-up. Simply precede each
numeric user ID and/or group ID with a ‘+’, in order to force its
interpretation as an integer:

``` 
 chown +42 F
 chgrp +$numeric_group_id another-file
 chown +0:+0 /
```

The name look-up process is skipped for each ‘+’-prefixed string,
because a string containing ‘+’ is never a valid user or group name.
This syntax is accepted on most common Unix systems, but not on Solaris
10.

Prev: Disambiguating names and IDs, Up: Common options

# Sources of random data

The ‘shuf’, ‘shred’, and ‘sort’ commands sometimes need random data to
do their work. For example, ‘sort -R’ must choose a hash function at
random, and it needs random data to make this selection.

By default these commands use an internal pseudo-random generator
initialized by a small amount of entropy, but can be directed to use an
external source with the ‘--random-source=FILE’ option. An error is
reported if FILE does not contain enough bytes.

For example, the device file ‘/dev/urandom’ could be used as the source
of random data. Typically, this device gathers environmental noise from
device drivers and other sources into an entropy pool, and uses the pool
to generate random bits. If the pool is short of data, the device reuses
the internal pool to produce more bits, using a cryptographically secure
pseudo-random number generator. But be aware that this device is not
designed for bulk random data generation and is relatively slow.

‘/dev/urandom’ suffices for most practical uses, but applications
requiring high-value or long-term protection of private data may require
an alternate data source like ‘/dev/random’ or ‘/dev/arandom’. The set
of available sources depends on your operating system.

To reproduce the results of an earlier invocation of a command, you can
save some random data into a file and then use that file as the random
source in earlier and later invocations of the command. Rather than
depending on a file, one can generate a reproducible arbitrary amount of
pseudo-random data given a seed value, using for example:

``` 
 get_seeded_random()
 {
   seed="$1"
   openssl enc -aes-256-ctr -pass pass:"$seed" -nosalt \
     </dev/zero 2>/dev/null
 }

 shuf -i1-100 --random-source=<(get_seeded_random 42)
```

Prev: Random sources, Up: Common options

# Target directory

The ‘cp’, ‘install’, ‘ln’, and ‘mv’ commands normally treat the last
operand specially when it is a directory or a symbolic link to a
directory. For example, ‘cp source dest’ is equivalent to ‘cp source
dest/source’ if ‘dest’ is a directory. Sometimes this behavior is not
exactly what is wanted, so these commands support the following options
to allow more fine-grained control:

‘-T’ ‘--no-target-directory’ Do not treat the last operand specially
when it is a directory or a symbolic link to a directory. This can help
avoid race conditions in programs that operate in a shared area. For
example, when the command ‘mv /tmp/source /tmp/dest’ succeeds, there is
no guarantee that ‘/tmp/source’ was renamed to ‘/tmp/dest’: it could
have been renamed to ‘/tmp/dest/source’ instead, if some other process
created ‘/tmp/dest’ as a directory. However, if ‘mv -T /tmp/source
/tmp/dest’ succeeds, there is no question that ‘/tmp/source’ was renamed
to ‘/tmp/dest’.

``` 
 In the opposite situation, where you want the last operand to be
 treated as a directory and want a diagnostic otherwise, you can use
 the ‘--target-directory’ (‘-t’) option.
```

‘-t DIRECTORY’ ‘--target-directory=DIRECTORY’ Use DIRECTORY as the
directory component of each destination file name.

``` 
 The interface for most programs is that after processing options
 and a finite (possibly zero) number of fixed-position arguments,
 the remaining argument list is either expected to be empty, or is a
 list of items (usually files) that will all be handled identically.
 The ‘xargs’ program is designed to work well with this convention.

 The commands in the ‘mv’-family are unusual in that they take a
 variable number of arguments with a special case at the _end_
 (namely, the target directory).  This makes it nontrivial to
 perform some operations, e.g., “move all files from here to ../d/”,
 because ‘mv * ../d/’ might exhaust the argument space, and ‘ls |
 xargs ...’ doesn’t have a clean way to specify an extra final
 argument for each invocation of the subject command.  (It can be
 done by going through a shell command, but that requires more human
 labor and brain power than it should.)

 The ‘--target-directory’ (‘-t’) option allows the ‘cp’, ‘install’,
 ‘ln’, and ‘mv’ programs to be used conveniently with ‘xargs’.  For
 example, you can move the files from the current directory to a
 sibling directory, ‘d’ like this:

      ls | xargs mv -t ../d --

 However, this doesn’t move files whose names begin with ‘.’.  If
 you use the GNU ‘find’ program, you can move those files too, with
 this command:

      find . -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 \
        | xargs mv -t ../d

 But both of the above approaches fail if there are no files in the
 current directory, or if any file has a name containing a blank or
 some other special characters.  The following example removes those
 limitations and requires both GNU ‘find’ and GNU ‘xargs’:

      find . -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -print0 \
        | xargs --null --no-run-if-empty \
            mv -t ../d
```

The ‘--target-directory’ (‘-t’) and ‘--no-target-directory’ (‘-T’)
options cannot be combined.

# Trailing slashes

Some GNU programs (at least ‘cp’ and ‘mv’) allow you to remove any
trailing slashes from each SOURCE argument before operating on it. The
‘--strip-trailing-slashes’ option enables this behavior.

This is useful when a SOURCE argument may have a trailing slash and
specify a symbolic link to a directory. This scenario is in fact rather
common because some shells can automatically append a trailing slash
when performing file name completion on such symbolic links. Without
this option, ‘mv’, for example, (via the system’s rename function) must
interpret a trailing slash as a request to dereference the symbolic link
and so must rename the indirectly referenced *directory* and not the
symbolic link. Although it may seem surprising that such behavior be the
default, it is required by POSIX and is consistent with other parts of
that standard.

# Traversing symlinks

The following options modify how ‘chown’ and ‘chgrp’ traverse a
hierarchy when the ‘--recursive’ (‘-R’) option is also specified. If
more than one of the following options is specified, only the final one
takes effect. These options specify whether processing a symbolic link
to a directory entails operating on just the symbolic link or on all
files in the hierarchy rooted at that directory.

These options are independent of ‘--dereference’ and ‘--no-dereference’
(‘-h’), which control whether to modify a symlink or its referent.

‘-H’ If ‘--recursive’ (‘-R’) is specified and a command line argument is
a symbolic link to a directory, traverse it.

‘-L’ In a recursive traversal, traverse every symbolic link to a
directory that is encountered.

‘-P’ Do not traverse any symbolic links. This is the default if none of
‘-H’, ‘-L’, or ‘-P’ is specified.

utilities, Prev: Traversing symlinks, Up: Common options

# Treating ‘/’ specially

Certain commands can operate destructively on entire hierarchies. For
example, if a user with appropriate privileges mistakenly runs ‘rm -rf /
tmp/junk’, that may remove all files on the entire system. Since there
are so few legitimate uses for such a command, GNU ‘rm’ normally
declines to operate on any directory that resolves to ‘/’. If you really
want to try to remove all the files on your system, you can use the
‘--no-preserve-root’ option, but the default behavior, specified by
the ‘--preserve-root’ option, is safer for most purposes.

The commands ‘chgrp’, ‘chmod’ and ‘chown’ can also operate destructively
on entire hierarchies, so they too support these options. Although,
unlike ‘rm’, they don’t actually unlink files, these commands are
arguably more dangerous when operating recursively on ‘/’, since they
often work much more quickly, and hence damage more files before an
alert user can interrupt them. Tradition and POSIX require these
commands to operate recursively on ‘/’, so they default to
‘--no-preserve-root’, but using the ‘--preserve-root’ option makes
them safer for most purposes. For convenience you can specify
‘--preserve-root’ in an alias or in a shell function.

Note that the ‘--preserve-root’ option also ensures that ‘chgrp’ and
‘chown’ do not modify ‘/’ even when dereferencing a symlink pointing
to ‘/’.

# Special built-in utilities

Some programs like ‘nice’ can invoke other programs; for example, the
command ‘nice cat file’ invokes the program ‘cat’ by executing the
command ‘cat file’. However, “special built-in utilities” like ‘exit’
cannot be invoked this way. For example, the command ‘nice exit’ does
not have a well-defined behavior: it may generate an error message
instead of exiting.

Here is a list of the special built-in utilities that are standardized
by POSIX 1003.1-2004.

``` 
 . : break continue eval exec exit export readonly return set shift
 times trap unset
```

For example, because ‘.’, ‘:’, and ‘exec’ are special, the commands
‘nice . foo.sh’, ‘nice :’, and ‘nice exec pwd’ do not work as you
might expect.

Many shells extend this list. For example, Bash has several extra
special built-in utilities like ‘history’, and ‘suspend’, and with Bash
the command ‘nice suspend’ generates an error message instead of
suspending.

# Standards conformance

In a few cases, the GNU utilities’ default behavior is incompatible with
the POSIX standard. To suppress these incompatibilities, define the
‘POSIXLY\_CORRECT’ environment variable. Unless you are checking for
POSIX conformance, you probably do not need to define
‘POSIXLY\_CORRECT’.

Newer versions of POSIX are occasionally incompatible with older
versions. For example, older versions of POSIX required the command
‘sort +1’ to sort based on the second and succeeding fields in each
input line, but in POSIX 1003.1-2001 the same command is required to
sort the file named ‘+1’, and you must instead use the command ‘sort -k
2’ to get the field-based sort. To complicate things further, POSIX
1003.1-2008 allows an implementation to have either the old or the new
behavior.

The GNU utilities normally conform to the version of POSIX that is
standard for your system. To cause them to conform to a different
version of POSIX, define the ‘\_POSIX2\_VERSION’ environment variable to
a value of the form YYYYMM specifying the year and month the standard
was adopted. Three values are currently supported for
‘\_POSIX2\_VERSION’: ‘199209’ stands for POSIX 1003.2-1992, ‘200112’
stands for POSIX 1003.1-2001, and ‘200809’ stands for POSIX 1003.1-2008.
For example, if you have a POSIX 1003.1-2001 system but are running
software containing traditional usage like ‘sort +1’ or ‘tail +10’, you
can work around the compatibility problems by setting
‘\_POSIX2\_VERSION=200809’ in your environment.
