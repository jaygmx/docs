# ‘who’: Print who is currently logged in

‘who’ prints information about users who are currently logged on.
Synopsis:

``` 
 who [OPTION] [FILE] [am i]
```

If given no non-option arguments, ‘who’ prints the following information
for each user currently logged on: login name, terminal line, login
time, and remote hostname or X display.

If given one non-option argument, ‘who’ uses that instead of a default
system-maintained file (often ‘/var/run/utmp’ or ‘/etc/utmp’) as the
name of the file containing the record of users logged on.
‘/var/log/wtmp’ is commonly given as an argument to ‘who’ to look at
who has previously logged on.

If given two non-option arguments, ‘who’ prints only the entry for the
user running it (determined from its standard input), preceded by the
hostname. Traditionally, the two arguments given are ‘am i’, as in ‘who
am i’.

Timestamps are listed according to the time zone rules specified by the
‘TZ’ environment variable, or by the system default rules if ‘TZ’ is
not set. \*Note Specifying the Time Zone with ‘TZ’: (libc)TZ Variable.

The program accepts the following options. Also see \*note Common
options::.

‘-a’ ‘--all’ Same as ‘-b -d --login -p -r -t -T -u’.

‘-b’ ‘--boot’ Print the date and time of last system boot.

‘-d’ ‘--dead’ Print information corresponding to dead processes.

‘-H’ ‘--heading’ Print a line of column headings.

‘-l’ ‘--login’ List only the entries that correspond to processes via
which the system is waiting for a user to login. The user name is always
‘LOGIN’.

‘--lookup’ Attempt to canonicalize hostnames found in utmp through a DNS
lookup. This is not the default because it can cause significant delays
on systems with automatic dial-up internet access.

‘-m’ Same as ‘who am i’.

‘-p’ ‘--process’ List active processes spawned by init.

‘-q’ ‘--count’ Print only the login names and the number of users logged
on. Overrides all other options.

‘-r’ ‘--runlevel’ Print the current (and maybe previous) run-level of
the init process.

‘-s’ Ignored; for compatibility with other versions of ‘who’.

‘-t’ ‘--time’ Print last system clock change.

‘-u’ After the login time, print the number of hours and minutes that
the user has been idle. ‘.’ means the user was active in the last
minute. ‘old’ means the user has been idle for more than 24 hours.

‘-w’ ‘-T’ ‘--mesg’ ‘--message’ ‘--writable’ After each login name print
a character indicating the user’s message status:

``` 
      ‘+’ allowing ‘write’ messages
      ‘-’ disallowing ‘write’ messages
      ‘?’ cannot find terminal device
```

The ‘who’ command is installed only on platforms with the POSIX
‘\<utmpx.h\>’ include file or equivalent, so portable scripts should
not rely on its existence on non-POSIX platforms.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.
