# ‘true’: Do nothing, successfully

‘true’ does nothing except return an exit status of 0, meaning
“success”. It can be used as a place holder in shell scripts where a
successful command is needed, although the shell built-in command ‘:’
(colon) may do the same thing faster. In most modern shells, ‘true’ is a
built-in command, so when you use ‘true’ in a script, you’re probably
using the built-in command, not the one documented here.

‘true’ honors the ‘--help’ and ‘--version’ options.

Note, however, that it is possible to cause ‘true’ to exit with nonzero
status: with the ‘--help’ or ‘--version’ option, and with standard
output already closed or redirected to a file that evokes an I/O error.
For example, using a Bourne-compatible shell:

```ash 
 $ ./true --version >&-
 ./true: write error: Bad file number
 $ ./true --version > /dev/full
 ./true: write error: No space left on device
```

This version of ‘true’ is implemented as a C program, and is thus more
secure and faster than a shell script implementation, and may safely be
used as a dummy shell for the purpose of disabling accounts.
