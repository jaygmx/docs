# ‘expand’: Convert tabs to spaces

‘expand’ writes the contents of each given FILE, or standard input if
none are given or for a FILE of ‘-’, to standard output, with tab
characters converted to the appropriate number of spaces.
Synopsis:

``` 
 expand [OPTION]... [FILE]...
```

By default, ‘expand’ converts all tabs to spaces. It preserves backspace
characters in the output; they decrement the column count for tab
calculations. The default action is equivalent to ‘-t 8’ (set tabs every
8 columns).

The program accepts the following options. Also see \*note Common
options::.

‘-t TAB1\[,TAB2\]...’ ‘--tabs=TAB1\[,TAB2\]...’ If only one tab stop is
given, set the tabs TAB1 spaces apart (default is 8). Otherwise, set the
tabs at columns TAB1, TAB2, ... (numbered from 0), and replace any tabs
beyond the last tab stop given with single spaces. Tab stops can be
separated by blanks as well as by commas.

``` 
 As a GNU extension the last TAB specified can be prefixed with a
 ‘/’ to indicate a tab size to use for remaining positions.  For
 example, ‘--tabs=2,4,/8’ will set tab stops at position 2 and 4,
 and every multiple of 8 after that.

 Also the last TAB specified can be prefixed with a ‘+’ to indicate
 a tab size to use for remaining positions, offset from the final
 explicitly specified tab stop.  For example, to ignore the 1
 character gutter present in diff output, one can specify a 1
 character offset using ‘--tabs=1,+8’, which will set tab stops at
 positions 1,9,17,...

 For compatibility, GNU ‘expand’ also accepts the obsolete option
 syntax, ‘-T1[,T2]...’.  New scripts should use ‘-t T1[,T2]...’
 instead.
```

‘-i’ ‘--initial’ Only convert initial tabs (those that precede all
non-space or non-tab characters) on each line to spaces.

An exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value indicates
failure.
